40204,"I am not opposed to removing the Castleman statue. I would miss having a horse in the neighborhood, however, so if it could be replaced by another rider, perhaps Oliver Lewis and Aristides, the first KY Derby winners, that would be cool.

Any statuary with confederate imagery should be removed. Period."
40299,"We should not have public murals and statues of leaders of the confederacy. The bottom line is that these men of the confederacy fought to keep hatred, bigotry and racism alive. I don't want our city to have statues honoring these men, because I know Louisville is an inclusive community dedicated to bringing different folks together."
40212,Remove all statues glorifying these traitors. I cant imagine what a PoC feels about these abominations.
40243,Please leave history ALONE...
40208,A democracy should have monuments celebrating the oppressed and not the oppressors. We need to tear down any monuments celebrating the Confederacy. 
40220," I also think you should add to this list nude portraits. paintings objectifying women, and paintings featuring people in poverty. I would recommend going through the library and removing all books before 1975 and blocking all websites that involve actual thinking. History has been written, to ignore it is unwise. Embrace the ability to learn from history and use those lessons to improve peoples lives today.  "
40215,"I have to say that I've been on the fence about the issue of removing public art commemorating Confederates, white supremacists, slave owners for a long time now. It seems on the surface like an issue of censorship. But here's where I finally landed: the history itself is not being censored. What we are doing when we remove public art that honors those who fought to divide our country, is refusing to be complicit as a community in the rosy depiction of would-be slavers. These statues serve as a reminder to all of us that Louisville cares more about preserving the likeness of men who only valued some (white, male) people than it does about making our community open and welcoming to all people who live in and visit our beautiful city.

Statues and monuments standing in public spaces are not the appropriate way to remember those who fought against the values of our community. Those pieces belong in museums, where they can be given proper context, and where people can choose to see them if they wish, rather than lurking around corner in the neighborhood where we live and play."
40204,"I strongly oppose any monument that glorifies the Confederacy, Confederate Soldiers, their acts, actions, victories, and defeats. These items belong in museum, where they can be placed in appropriate historical context, not on our streets, sidewalks, parks, and public buildings. No amount of civic pride or action can undo the work of men who would conspire and fight to keep other humans in chains.

We have better civic heroes to honor than these men, including but not limited to John B. Castleman. 

I support the removal of these monuments at any public cost."
40059,Wouldn't it be better to do this after everything kind of calms down?  You seem to be stoking the fire.
40291,"The statue of John Breckinridge Castleman should be removed, as should monuments to the Civil War in Cave Hill Cemetary. Castleman certainly did good things AFTER the war ended, but that doesn't negate the fact that he recruited, spied, and fought for the Confederacy in an attempt to continue the horrific institution of slavery. Monuments are for heroes, not for traitors who thought owning humans was right."
40204,Many of these statues are monuments to Jim Crow and an era of terror for marginalized communities. Those that are not are now associated with ongoing and continued terrorism and acts of white supremacy. It is time to remove these monuments to make it clear that public spaces are places where all are welcome and can and should feel safe. Please remove these. They honor oppression and racist ideals. 
40205,"Remove statues honoring those who furthered the cause of the confederacy. Place them in a memorial park as relics of an era we reject and do not wish to relive. Commission new works to replace them from artists of color. I suspect the Cherokee Triangle Association would be very excited to have a statue by local, renowned artist Ed Hamilton or the like. Honor the change we are capable of making as a society AND remember the past in a way that makes it clear it's not acceptable. It's not that hard to do the right thing here in a way that appeases most people. "
40214,"Leave the statues and if they are deemed offensive to some, then use the opportunity to develop context of history for the public.  There are so many older adults who don't know history, they have just learned to have racist opinions.  It's time to have the conversation, but it takes two sides to have a conversation and will only have value if both sides are willing to listen.
This community has too little public art.  Art has always been a vehicle for free expression.  Perhaps if there are other artistic public pieces that honor a wider spectrum of our history such as women who have long been ignored in this genre' , then perhaps we can find a way to learn and then a way to acceptance."
40217,"Who we choose to memorialize and how matters — it is a public declaration of our community's values. We can't say we condemn the Confederacy and slavery yet justify honoring one of its prominent agents because he's not in uniform, because he then went on to be a wealthy landowner, because he contributed to the founding of our parks system (and the extent and value of that contribution has been disputed). Do we value Louisville's parks over the dignity and humanity of Louisville's black residents? Do we only abhor the glorification of the Confederacy when it's holding a sword, or flying from the back of a pickup truck, or shouting hate speech at a neo-Nazi rally? Or do we hold the wealthy, the polite, the bronzed to the same standards as the loud, the uncouth, the unmistakable agents of hate? I believe many people did not know until recently, or perhaps just never thought deeply until recently, who Castleman was. It is a privilege to walk or drive by statues of prominent men every day and not think about who they were and what they stood for. But now that we are all talking about it, what will we decide to do about it?"
40204,"Please remove John B Castleman. Monuments like these need to be in a museum. We are not ""erasing"" or ""sanitizing"" history like many have claimed. We just simply know better, now. We can be better. We can create a city in which all feel welcome and their voices heard. Most people outraged over these removals are white - What about the voices of color? We need to take ALL perspectives into consideration, and our dialogue & action needs to focus on justice. "
40299,"The Statue in Cherokee Park does not celebrate what he did in the civil war, it celebrates what he did for this community. I would like to see this statue remain in the park. I hope my feelings on this matter will be considered."
40208,"This is the moment where we choose a side, and its important we stand for American values. We must remove all monuments to the confederacy because they have no place in our future. They are relics of past traitors and their homes should museums."
40205,"Castleman was sentenced to death for spying on the United States, attacked U.S. citizens and the U.S. military, was exiled to France, sold a small piece of his land at a marked up price to Louisville to build Tyler Park (as a result received a nice property value increase for the remainder of his land that he marketed as being near Tyler Park), and was responsible for segregating the parks after seeing African-Americans playing tennis in Cherokee Park, and those parks embarrassingly stayed segregated until 1954.  During the Spanish-American war he and his militia did not engage in any actual combat and showed up in Puerto Rico as the war ended. His statue should go."
40206,"The Castleman statue in the Cherokee triangle absolutely honors bigotry, racism, and slavery. No interpretation necessary. Castleman not only fought for the Confederacy, he also perpetuated racist ideas and practices throughout his whole life. Why would a traitor to our country, who also happens to be a racist bigot, deserve a statue?

While removing a Confederate statue is only a small action in the scope of the social justice work that needs to be done in Louisville and throughout our country, it's a relatively easy one. Our communities of color have demanded that it come down, and all Louisvillians should stand in solidarity with them. Take it down. Today."
40213,"This isn't complicated. You don't put white supremacists on pedestals, so removing public shrines to slavery's defenders is a necessary and worthy project. The fact that the Mayor even wants to take a poll on this demonstrates how dishearteningly weak, lukewarm, and accommodating his ""progressivism"" is. This is not the time (if there ever was one) to lead from a morally vacuous center. Pick a side, Mr. Mayor."
40272,"I am strongly opposed to the removal of any monument or statue.  Life was quite different in this country during the ""Civil War"" era.  The beginning of the  War and the heroes involved was not fought for slavery; that issue didn't come up until will into the battles.  Most of us had ancestors in the Civil War and that history should not disappear.  Many had great accomplishments and the people were proud of them.  If we do away with those heros, what happens to the heros of other wars?  We are sending the wrong message to past, present and our future military.  If anyone feels uncomfortable due to a monument/statue they have more serious issues that need to be dealt with.   The mere discussion of any monument just 'stirs the hate pot' in this city.  There is enough hate without building a separation between black and white?  I appreciate all monuments, but if some have to go they all should go; including Ali and MLK.  Perhaps, education is the key we all missing."
40205,Fleur de lis are offensive due to their use in branding by some slave owners.  Animal heads outside of Speed Art Musuem are disturbing and giant wish bone is implying what?
40208,"These are not pieces of art nor are they representations of history. They are works that glorify the acts of people who worked to tear this country apart. They let people know that being a part of groups that support bigotry, racism, and slavery are acceptable in our city and in this country. These displays show a pride in being a part of those things. If we want to heal and come together as a country we need to stop glorifying the past. We need to stop being proud of a history that enslaved Africans and dragged them here. We need to stop being proud of the genocide of Native Americans. We need to stop being proud of the systemic racism that is continuing today. We need to replace these displays that show how we, as a city and as a country, can move on together and build the community we want in Louisville. We tore down Nazi flags and symbols at the end of WWII and they were never replaced in Europe, we tore down the Berlin Wall at the end of the Cold War and it was never replaced. These displays were not even put up until long after the Civil War was over. They should be tore down and not replaced. There should be no glory for the traitors nor those who want to continue their work. "
40204,"I wish for you to know that I do not support celebrating hatred.  This includes statues that honor those that supported slavery such as the Castleman statue near Willow Park.  These icons of hatred should be removed from public spaces & replaced with with symbols of hope, and inclusivity for all.  Louisville is a community that is an amalgamation of a rainbow of races, cultures, religions & sexual identities.  The message we need to show the world is that we have space for everyone and we are looking towards a hopeful, peaceful and colorful future.  "
40217,"I strongly oppose any monument that glorifies the Confederacy, Confederate Soldiers, their acts, actions, victories, and defeats. While some may argue that they represent Louisville's tradition or heritage, I believe that they would be better placed in their appropriate historical context in museums, not valorized in public. They represent a continual reminder of a dark period in history, the repercussions of which echo into the present day. Louisville has far better, more righteous, more honorable citizens, men and women both, to represent its public image. I support the removal of these monuments at any public cost."
40165,"I reject the argument that moving a statue is erasing history. Presenting a tangible token is merely helpful in the teaching of history, it is not necessary. With the advent of advanced audio and visual technology, there are many ways to experience histories without hands on artifacts. Moving a statue would, on the contrary, add to the piece's history.

I believe that retaining the Castleman statue in its present location, surrounded by expensive homes and ringed by tended gardens, does not place the appropriate judgments on the historical events with which Castleman is associated, nor does it send the appropriate message to persons whose ancestors were egregiously harmed by events prior to emancipation, nor to those who have been personally harmed by the systemic oppression which has continued in many forms up until the present day. I advocate for the relocation of this and any other Confederate memorials/relics/tributes to a museum-type setting, in which items can be curated to ensure that the items can be studied in a manner that does not suggest that Louisville continues to uphold and treasure the ideology widely associated with Confederate symbols.

My best analogy is this: Would you be alright with displaying in your living room photographs of your spouse's first marriage? These photographs documented an important part of your spouse's personal history- s/he would not exist in the current form you love so well, had s/he not experienced that first marriage. But I would certainly wager that you would request for these photos occupy a box in the closet. Or the attic. Or even that they be destroyed. And should your spouse insist on keeping the photographs in the living room even after you, the affected party, requested alternate storage options, well... that would hardly bode well for harmonious marital conditions, would it? 

In summary, we encourage relocation and/or destruction of personal historical artifacts in cases of potential emotional discord. Why not embrace this opportunity to do this for our brothers and sisters in our community at large?"
40203,"PLEASE do the right thing with regard to public art by REMOVING that which commemorates racism, colonization, and oppression of those in marginalized communities. I realize this could be a difficult decision, but it can also be an easy one. There is not a shortage of monuments to the history of white men concurring spaces. That piece of our ugly past can never be erased. There is an overwhelming lack of recognition for work done by women, and people of color which did have great impact on many in our communities. 
Please make Louisville an example of how we can encourage others to embrace diversity by lifting up people and stories that are NOT what we usually see when we look around our US cities.

Thanks for this easy way to share my stance on this subject, and for taking swift and clear action here, as there is much more work to be done to help our city become more equitable and safer feeling for all of us."
40206,"Take down all Confederate monuments. Melt them down, recycle them, or sell them for scrap. They have no place in the public sphere. They serve to empower racists and bigots, allow them to feel that their beliefs are normal and acceptable, and to both reminisce and feel resolve about their hatred, fear, and false superiority.

Doing so doesn't ""erase"" or ""sanitize"" history, as our governor and president would make one think. Much as Germany doesn't herald the days of their vicious past, and as the people of Iraq couldn't wait to topple both their regime AND the symbols and idols of the same, we should not allow these vestiges of Jim Crow to remain standing.

Mr Mayor, tear down these statues!"
40217,"Melt them down, make an Ali statue, make a memorial to lynching victims, commemorate Louisville being the gateway to the north. Just get rid of them."
40217,"Please remove ALL confederate statues, including the Castleman Monument in the Cherokee Triangle."
40204,"Take the General down.

Put Fredrick Law Olmsted on the horse or of him standing alone.

He could be pointing to the Park or have plans in his hands."
40205,"The John B. Castleman Statue is listed in the National Register as a Civil War monument recognizing a Confederate officer, making it a Confederate monument, thus attaching it firmly to a legacy of bigotry, racism and slavery. It was built in the same era that the city's former Confederate monument was dedicated, as the city had no hesitation honoring the Confederacy at that time, and the Confederacy is mentioned on the plaque. The National Register listing makes it clear that the monument's significance is - above anything else - its connection to the Confederacy.

Mr. Castleman was unrepentant about his love for his dear Confederacy, touting his CSA service on the cover of his autobiography, dedicating the book to fellow CSA officers ""and to the boys who with them served and feared nothing,"" printing an introduction by a fellow CSA officer who wistfully reflects on what might have been had the CSA prevailed, and romanticizing slavery (example from Chapter XIII, describing Kentucky slaves: ""These slaves were part of every family. Their work was not hard, and their hours of leisure were many... almost always, contentment and happiness prevailed."") This book, published at the end of his life, is not the work of someone who regretted his treason or sought to disassociate himself from it. Rather, it is the work of a proud racist, reflecting proudly on his life and heritage.

There is no justification for keeping this statue in a public square. If it is a Confederate monument - and it clearly is - there's precedent for removing it, and a moral obligation to do so."
40272," No art , symbol , statute etc  can  honor bigotry, racism or slavery by their mere presence in our city.
 A person own actions is what honor such display of ignorance like bigotry, racism, or slavery. 
The art itself its our amazing History.  why wipe out our History (art ) and keep bigotry, racism, slavery in our hearts? 
We cant advance in unity without remembering where we were in the past. What are we leaving our children and grandchildren to actually see and touch about our true history...an App? 
Leave the art alone! #HispanicsinLouisville "
40065,"Dont you dare sanitize the city.  Liberal schools are doing enough harm by not teaching the truth about history! Only communist countries hide their past from their people!  Educate people about the wrongs of our past!  What an insult to the 600,000 good people who died in the civil war!"
40206,"I have never viewed the Castleman Horse statue as a homage to the Confederacy as he also fought for the US army also and was instrumental in land development. Someone suggested re-wording the plaque instead of tearing it down. (which I agree with) The statue has history of being a landmark in Cherokee Triangle and has artistic value and is steeped in folk-lore. 

I think all statues like this should be reviewed and evaluated at this time as Louisville should not be representing offensive groups who rally these monuments out of racism under the guise of saving historical art. Some 'art' needs to be torn down or replaced. While Castleman may or may not be one of them, there are other monuments in KY that definitely should go."
40204,"I am exceedingly liberal in my political views.  However, I am realistic about history and learning from it.  I would not be in favor of any public art being removed unless it is blatantly offensive.  I do not consider the Castleman statue to be offensive at all.  He may have fought in the Civil War for the wrong side, but there was much more to him than that.  How can someone say that the statue only represents the Confederacy?  Please don't give in to irrational arguments from either side.  Just keep history AND offensive displays in mind when making your decision!"
,Moving an offensive statue doesn't make it less offensive. It just tells those offended you aren't w welcome in the area you move it to. Sad if you use their tax dollars to create that area. These monuments were put in place to remind non white persons and non  Christian folks who's still in charge. You have the opportunity and the moment in history to say for ever that is no longer the case. Or you can just another politician doing half measures . You were a businessman bit know your a leader this is a rare opportunity to lead and stand above the others. Risk Reward.
40217,"I feel that any statue or piece of art representing the Confederacy should be promptly taken down. Such work symbolizes bigotry, racism, and a time when our country was deeply divided. All these figures were fighting for the right to own human beings as property which is beyond vile. They were fighting to be openly bigoted and commit violent acts without punishment. 

I feel that public art should promote unity, celebrate the community, and benefit the neighbors they reside. They should not be a reminder of horrible acts that are triggering to anyone. We need to stop glorifying war and violence."
40205,"Once you identify them, take them down.  But you need to budget for what will go up in their place.  You can't just leave a hole in the  landscape of people's everyday lives.  We don't want people constantly mourning the loss of these symbols of hate.

Put something inspiring up in their place.  Use this as an opportunity to discuss what Louisville is really about and where we are going as a people."
40214,"There's absolutely no question that both the Castelman statue on Cherokee Road and the Prentice statue behind the Louisville Free Public Library Downtown Branch need to be removed. Louisville Metro government has an implicit commitment to serve all of Louisville's citizens, and displays from the past that inherently celebrate, through their very existence, the exploits of white supremacists and bigots have no place in our society."
40205,"Please remove any statue that is honoring bigotry, racism, or slavery.
In particulary, the Castleman statue is in my district, and I would like it removed. "
40204,"Any monument that honors bigotry, racism or slavery (and this includes monuments to the Confederacy or Confederate soldiers) should not be allowed to remain on display as a public piece of art. The minimum acceptable response is to relocate them to an exhibit that clearly contextualizes them as part of racist tradition that includes slavery, segregation, and Jim Crow laws.

Rather than keeping monuments that glorify those that were on the losing side- militarily and morally- we should erect new monuments to the victims and heroes of the struggle for equal rights for all."
40205,"Please remove the statue - - it's a reminder of segregation, the confederacy, and treason. It does not represent our community."
40204,"The Castleman statue has no place in our 21st century community.  Removing the statue is not a sign that we are trying to ignore or erase history as some have said; rather it shows that Castleman's legacy as a confederate solider is not something to be memorialized and celebrated.  A monument to any person is a way to idealize and celebrate their life and legacy.  The time has come to re-evaluate the statue and it's meaning, and to take appropriate action by removing it from Cherokee Circle."
40241,"Let's move forward, not look at the past.  Remove/replace ""art"" with pieces that are not a reminder to others of history we do not want to repeat."
40217, Support a Sanctuary City ordinance in Louisville because you cannot relocate statues and remove art void of policy change/creation.
40205,"Mayor Fisher You are embarrassing your self.This is a confederate statue. There is no further discussion needed. Remove it!

Be a true compassionate city and make Louisville a sanctuary city!"
40228,"Are you also going to remove photos from our history books.  Most art tells a story.  There is art I find offensive, but I don't ask for it to be removed or ask that we deny our history.  If you start this process, it will bleed over into other aspects of our lives "
40213,"Leave the statues and monuments alone!  I do not agree with the actions of the white supremacists but I also do not agree with taking down the statues.  If we are to learn from history, we need reminders to show us from where we came.  Next month, I am traveling to Greece for the first time.  Greece would not be the same country if the monuments and statues were gone.  Every country has a history but not every country is willing to remove reminders of history because people are offended.  America has become too soft.  We need to grow a backbone and we need to understand that history cannot be erased because the statues are gone.  Some people may not like Abe Lincoln; crazy, I know.  Are we looking to remove his monument from the waterfront area?  Seriously, when does it end?"
40065,"If we are going to start banning all those things we consider offensive, what would we have left?  I personally view monuments and the like to be imagery of art.  I do not not necessarily have to like or agree with all of them.  If we are going down this road where we remove everything offensive to African-Americans, how is it we have not demolished every last single antebellum home which resides in the South?  After all, what could be more of a sign of oppression than the plantations dotted and advertised throughout the South and even listed on our GPS when we travel?  

If we want to talk about offensive, how is it we still see crosses and monuments throughout society depicting every form of religion?   A quarter of our nation is now secular and these symbolic images are extremely oppressive and offensive to those who do not believe the same things.  How is this even remotely acceptable to our leaders seeking to appease those who do not wish to be offended?  Seriously?  I have no problem whatsoever with the removal of religious imagery like the Ten Commandments from our government buildings, but how is it even remotely acceptable to leave all imagery of Crucifixes and Stars of Davids inundated throughout our society?  How is it acceptable for churches to continue to ring their church bells playing their favorite hymns?

How is it we have a center in Louisville to applaud a person whose only claim to fame is that he was a boxer for a living and he used his influence to evade the draft?  What sport is more archaic than one where fighting is its theme and its members constantly receive brain injuries?  What is more barbaric than this?  Yes, there are many of us offended by cockfighting, dog-fighting and bullfighting.  I notice the latter is still applauded in some circles.  Or is it just not considered offensive when people or celebrities possess money?  I find it offensive we live in a city where boxing is still even promoted as a legitimate sport.

How is it not considered offensive to many when we see streets or buildings named after Martin Luther King?  Yes, the words he spoke were extraordinarily significant but was he not found shot outside a motel where he enjoyed time with someone other than his wife?  What is more offensive than driving through every urban area in our country and finding neighborhoods dotted with graffiti, trash and crime?  Why should anyone be forced to drive through these dangerous and anti-aesthetic areas of town?   If the Confederate flag is considered offensive to blacks, how is the BLM, Antifa, and other Leftist organization icons not offensive to their detractors when we see them thrown at us on social media or the news?  

PETA has screamed and holler for years about those things which offend them.  How is it our leaders have not accommodated their needs and wishes?  How is one group's claim of oppression greater than another's?

To be completely honest, I have no problems removing all things which might be considered offensive to particular groups in this country.  But if we are going to do it for one group, we better start removing those things everybody else also finds offensive.  "
40118,"To the Commission,

As a citizen of Jefferson County and city of Louisville I do not feel that the Confederate monuments are considered Art that is defined by bigotry, racism and or slavery.  We do not worship slavery in this country any longer.  The men and women, white and black that fought this war are to be remembered and they should be looked upon as a great lesson for all Americans. They are History. History is neither all good and all bad.  I would rather see racial differences approached with more help from City, State and Federal governments on finding out the root causes for bigotry, racism that continue in this country.  Education and freedoms taught to citizens should put to rest resentments and victim roles.  We as a county need to define ourselves with building up our citizens with mental health help, health insurance needs and using the resources that are here to help people live with healthy minds.  Political Correctness needs to go in the garbage and city, state and federal officials need to start doing what is right and not continue to stand for things that are to far left and to far right.  Double standards need to go away and all people treated fairly. The violence that has erupted over Slavery or thoughts of Slavery is ridiculous at this time in our country.  People of the United States are not enslaved. Why are they so mad?  American's have lost gratitude for what we do have and that is the right to be free and to be kind to one another. 

Thank You,
Angie Spiva"
40204,"If the signage at the Cherokee Triangle monument was removed and replaced with signage that simply states: ""1913: Horse with Rider"", would the controversy cease?  I can't imagine anyone passing that statue and thinking anything ugly; only what a lovely art piece in this beautiful neighborhood.  My 3 year old grandson takes delight every time we pass The Horse Statue. He has no vile thoughts brought to mind because of the statue.  I would like to see the horse statue remain, and if the signage needs to change, so be it.  Removing the statue does not change history, and the art itself does not endorse a political ideology. "
40205,"The confederate monuments around town have no place standing in 2017. Please have them removed/destroyed, as relocating them would be prioritizing white nationalism over the ideas of freedom and justice. "
40205,I would like to see the statue moved to a museum. That is where this piece of history should be. I would suggest replacing him with Frederick Olmstead. I encourage this to happen in a very quick manner so our community can get past this and so our community can set precedent and be an example for other districts in Kentucky.
40211,"I think many of us would agree that any piece of art that honors bigotry, racism, or slavery should not be displayed in public places nor maintained with public funds.  But, when deciding if a piece of art constitute honoring racism and bigotry, we should use extreme caution. We should consider context and the artist’s intent before making the claim that an piece of art is racist, e.g., a painting of a swastika superimposed over an American flag could be considered racist if created by a neo Nazi, but the same painting could be a form of social commentary if created by an avowed anti-racist.  
 

 

"
40205,"Louisville is a growing and diverse city which aims to be compassionate, and a Confederate solider who used guerrilla tactics who also contributed to the segregation of our parks is not the type of person we should honor with a statue. Many people do not know the history behind this statue, and surely would not want it to represent our city or neighborhood upon learning the truth.

We urge you to please remove this statue promptly. Thank you for your consideration."
40205,"The Castleman statue may represent many things. One of the things it represents is a Confederate soldier who when tasked with leading the city's parks chose to institute segregation. Having Tom Owen paraded out on TV as if he is some monument expert -- when he is not, he is an archivist -- to ""interpret"" the monument by asking some insulting questions about what the person is wearing and what does the sign say does not help this situation. Castleman must come down! Castleman is a racist. He did nothing to deserve this honor -- other than being a rich, white, Confederate spy who chose to segregate Louisville's parks. He represents the worst of Louisville -- not its best. I'm further insulted the neighborhood leaders of the Cherokee Triangle CONTINUE to make excuses for this racist. Several of us raised concerns about this statue with leaders of the Cherokee Triangle many years ago and they ignored us. Instead, they doubled-down on this racist man and added Castleman's likeness to their logo, websites, art fair promotion, etc. The statue must be removed. I will boycott the Cherokee Triangle Art Fair until this statue is removed. The Louisville Commission on Public Art should hold a contest to solicit entries for a new statue for this pedestal. Stick Castleman in the basement of the Speed Art Museum or Tom Owen's backyard. "
40229,"Historic art, in the form of statues of soldiers, should be left completely alone. I do not abide with the fascist tendency of certain groups when it comes to removing historic statues. And it would be nice to see our Mayor and our Police Chief take the vandalism of the statue in Cherokee Triangle of John Breckinridge Castleman seriously enough to actually investigate the crime and publicly denounce such acts of disrespect. But I don't believe either the Mayor or Police Chief have the intestinal fortitude or moral compass to stand against the fascists."
40206,It's about time 
4219,"Stop taken down the  statues, that is our history! "
40241,"Honoring bigotry, racism, or slavery?  No.  These statutes and monuments do none of those things.  It would be honoring ignorance to take them down.  Over 100 years have gone by and nobody cared the first time about them.  However, suddenly, it is popular to display one's ignorance of history by erasing what you don't get or understand in the first place."
40204,Castleman was a traitor and racist.  His contribution to the parks is much over blown and in fact he wanted the parks to be segregated.  Take it Down.  Send on down the road with the Davis statue ... Or take him down and keep the horse.  He is probably tired of a racist on his back.  
40214,"Support sanctuary city. Build a city reparation fund for housing solutions. Change street names, park names, anything having to do with the lost cause. Designate a place where those relics can live and tell the full story of the oppression of the confederacy. "
42714,I don't think the art should be removed from Louisville..I visit these places with friends and family ..if they were not there I don't think I would visit Louisville as often as I do! It's really sad that this is happening.. it is our history good bad or ugly it's still our history… Black or white it's still our history… And it's a shame  that it has come to this situation to where we have to try to remove and erase the history of our nation ..  removing these objects will not erase our past… We should build from our history and learn from our history.
40216,They belong in a museum.
40204,"This is for public art review, but the castleman statue can hardly be considered that. It is an erection to a self serving racist who's accomplishments are completely embellished by himself and his cronies. Any man that demands a statue of himself probably doesn't deserve it. "
40205,Move the statues to a museum and present them in historical context. Use them as tools to educate about a dark time in our history when traitors attacked the union. They should not be publically displayed because they have come to represent not history but a battle cry for white. 
40205,Put it to a vote and let the people decide... quit inciting violent demonstrations and let the community vote on it.  
40222,"We must balance the kind of society we would like to be with the rights provided with the First Amendment. There is no need for art pieces in public spaces that honor the enemies of America or her values, it only serves to exhalt the bigoted values for which they once stood. It is time to move beyond our shameful history. Instead, they should be placed in museums alongside an explanation of why their statue was placed in Louisville, what it represented, and why it was ultimately removed. The President of the United States asked if we should remove statues of Thomas Jefferson or George Washington since they owned slaves. I would urge the committee to consider their history as a whole: Did they actively promote slave ownership? Did they make their last stand on the right to own another person? Did they foment insurrection against their own nation for the right to subjugate black people? I would say there is a difference between Thomas Jefferson and George Washington and people like Jefferson Davis or Robert E. Lee. And indeed, perhaps we should consider adding to any statute of Thomas Jefferson, that while he wrote that all men are created equal, that he himself owned slaves. "
40242,"I don't see why these art pieces would need to be removed.   They serve as reminders of dark times and should remain as a way to say never again.  If we forget history, we will be doomed to repeat it."
40222,"Leave the art alone. Erasing the history of where we came from will do nothing to make race relations better, and in fact is sure to inflame the situation. 

These markers are the scars of the fights we have been through for freedom, and despite current pop culture, the Civil War was NOT fought over slavery, but rather due to a dictatorial and overreaching federal government. Slavery was already on its way out and socially unacceptable.

Leave the art, monuments, and other treasures of our past alone."
40213,"Our country has become entrenched in outrage & overreaction. We all need to take a deep breath & relax, rather than rushing to judgment & destroying local artwork that may hold historical significance & isn't just a symbol of racism & oppression. Our country is rooted in deep history, some of which we are now ashamed of, but ridding ourselves of suspect artwork will not change any previous actions. If artwork is deemed inappropriate or lewd, I understand it's removal, but there are several things that exist today in public areas that we ""just don't like"". But that doesn't mean it should be censored. "
40219,"Maybe the Frazier museum should be shut down and all the art removed so it doesn't offend anyone. Removing history isn't the answer. Then how do you explain to black children about slavery is you're wiping away all the history. As if it never happened. Is that what you're wanting? That means no more civil war and slavery taught in schools, no more brainwashing blacks to think they aren't equal. That ruins the Democrat agenda for votes. Don't become ISIS!!!!"
40243,"LEAVE THEM ALONE! What kind of downward spiral are you trying to crate? You want to take down statues and historical markers, what's next? You will then have to look into renaming buildings, streets, maybe even the city if you want to really dig into things. Your job as Mayor isn't to become a judge and jury of our city history. You should know you will never please everyone, however it's clear which direction you are easily influenced by. Seeing you put more effort and concern into the cities outrageous murder rate would be a better use of your time. "
40213,Leave the monuments!  The Castleman Statue shows a man in suit who created our parks and The American Saddlebread Association.  It has nothing to do with slavery nor was it mad eto depict slavery.  
40205,"The only acceptable policy for Louisville to take on Confederate monuments is zero tolerance & immediate removal. There is an argument to be made for remembering the past & keeping such monuments as reminders, to these concerns I say melt the statues down and cast the metal into new, more appropriate forms. We should be celebrating those who persevere(d) & suffer(ed) in the face of racism, not honoring & memorializing the perpetrators of horrible acts & treason.

There is NO place in contemporary Louisville for such monuments. Remove them NOW."
40229,"I would very much like for the Castleman statue to be brought down. In the current times, honoring someone who fought so hard to retain a system of society that promoted oppression of others based on race and also their ownership, has no place in our world. It belongs somewhere in a museum, preferably retaining it's vandalism marks as a sign of the controversy and the changing shape of attitudes regarding it. These acts are as much a part of the history of the monument as what it stands for. I would very much like to see it torn down in complete honesty, smashed before a cheering crowd, than see it stay up to become a rallying cry for extremists or an everyday reminder that the oppression of people of color is seemingly something still deserving of being honored."
40205,"I think that the statutes that were made to honor confederate soldiers or whatever should stay. The reason why I say they should stay is because by getting rid of the statue you are erasing history that needs to be taught by getting rid of the statues you are making sure that what they did before is going to happen again. Another reason why the statue should stay is because it’s going to cost a ton of money, money that should be better spent then getting rid of a statue that has no meaning
anymore. Keep it so we don’t repeat the past."
40205,"There is a difference between public art as education about history and public art that is glorifying racism, a system of slavery, oppression, etc. 
It's the difference between having a statue memorializing Adolph Hitler in a German city and having a place to learn about the horrors of WWII at the Holocaust Museum. 

We are creating a hostile atmosphere for the diverse people of our community when public artwork exists in a way that normalizes and/or glorifies those who are seen as heroes or symbols of slavery, oppression, violence, etc. 

What do we want to intentionally create for our community? For me, it's art that inspires, welcomes, celebrates the diversity of the community, the strengths of the community, and the contributions of the community members. 



"
40241,Take down all Confederate statues. They are NOT heroes.  They were traitors to the United States of America. They killed Americans.  It is painfully clear that the people wanting these things to remain are hate filled people after what happened in Charlottesville. As Americans we MUST remove these symbols of hate. ALL of them. 
40258,These monuments are wrong.  Period. Remove them. 
40299,"Nazis and white supremacists have no place here in the 21st century. The failed rebellion that occurred in the 19th century should not be immortalized with monuments in public places, they belong in museums and in history books."
40222,"Please remove any public art that may be offensive or attract the kind of violence that has recently occurred elsewhere. I can only imagine the types of feelings they invoke in those that were most affected. I understand that the common argument is that removing the statues won't change history. While that is correct, by having them remain, it is not stopping us from repeating our past either. They simple can do no good by remaining. Please consider removing them quietly and with no advance warning so as to minimize any formal gathering of protest groups. I don't want to see Louisville on the news like Charlottesville. Let's set an example for other cities facing the same decision and create a roadmap for how to handle this peacefully."
40217,Art often offends and stirs conversation and contemplation.  Leave the statues in place.
40206,Remove these monuments that honor hate. We can still teach and learn from history without them in our public spaces. They belong in a civil rights museum or other consolidated area where educational material about our history can be shared. 
40245,"I have lived in Louisville my entire, and I love this great city. Mayor Fischer, you and I disagree on a great number of things, but the desire to make Louisville a safe, welcoming city is where we share common ground. I am one of the many people who see the destruction of statues and monuments as a farce when it comes to addressing the problems facing our society, but I can see where certain groups of people would consider their current place on society as a celebration of a backwards mindset. That being said, I'm in support of relocating the statues to a location where they can be observed in proper context.

My main concern, Mayor Fischer, is that in relocating these statues, you desire to make an example out of Louisville. You don't have bad intentions in doing so, you want to show the rest of the country that proper steps can be taken to address an issue in the city. I get that. The downside of this, that I hope you will consider and potentially change your approach to the matter, is that in attempting to make a positive example out of Louisville, we are inviting modern day Nazis and Communists to clash in our streets as they did in Charlottesville. That is the exact opposite of what this city needs. That will not make our city safer, more welcoming or more accepting. It will put the lives of our police officers at risk, it will put the lives of protestors at risk, it will put the lives of innocent bystanders at risk and the blood will be on the hands of those who stirred the pot by making certain pieces of information available to the public.

I ask that you take into consideration other means of addressing the issue. If you plan to relocate a monument, make arrangements to do so quietly for the good of everyone who would feel the effects of large scale, violent protests taking place."
40205,I would like to see the Castleman statue removed. I would also like transparency in the discussions and decisions about the financing of the projects and where these objects will be relocated or stored. I appreciate the responsiveness of Metro government in addressing these important issues. 
40206,"Confederate statues should be removed from public spaces. Removing them does not ""sanitize"" or cover up history, and keeping them only serves to remind a significant portion of our population that they were, for too long, treated as non-human.  Should the Commission decide to keep Confederate statues, I would suggest that historical markers be included with each that explain the Confederacy's attempt to tear apart the United States and the devastating, long-term impact of The Civil War, including segregation, racism and violence against disenfranchised minorities. Thank you for this opportunity to contribute to the discussion."
40214,"Please remove the statues. It's not erasing history, per se. If we want to remember the Civil War through statues, we should erect statues that commemorate heroes and those who fought against slavery and hate. And, while we're at it,maybe revise the curriculum in our public schools to include more visibility to defectors, than those who fought to keep an entire race enslaved."
40217,"Thank you for your initiative in getting this started, Mayor Fisher.

I do hope the Commission will take a hard look at the George D. Prentice statue in front of the Library. Since I was a child, I always wondered how a man who supported slavery and the Know Nothing Party could be memorialized this way. The Journal promoted his ideas, and led to Bloody Sunday in our streets.

I appreciate the opportunity to express these thoughts. As I've said to others, it's nice to have elected officials who actually WANT to hear from all their constituents."
40245,"George Washington owned slaves.  Thus, the Washington Monument can be interpreted as honoring bigotry, racism and/or slavery.  Should the Washington Monument be removed?  

Thomas Jefferson owned slaves.  Thus, the Jefferson Memorial can be interpreted as honoring bigotry, racism and/or slavery.  Should the Jefferson Memorial be removed?  If you even entertain these questions, you are unfit to serve in any government in America. 

Closer to home, Louis XVI was an absolute monarch who surely embraced racism and bigotry, if not actual slavery.  Should the statute of Louis XVI be removed?  If not, what is the argument for leaving it in place while removing the Castleman statue?  

For that matter, Louisville was named for him.  Should the city name be changed?  Jefferson County is named after a slave owner.  Should the county name be changed?  If the Castleman statue is to be removed, what is the argument for failing to rename the county? 

The Castleman statue is not a monument to a Confederate officer.  It is a monument to a civic leader.  Removing it would be an act of cowardice, an act of historical and cultural violence worthy of the Taliban, who have infamously destroyed historical and cultural monuments, and of the Soviet Communists, who routinely airbrushed history to suit their political needs.  


"
40272,"I would like to know where it will stop. Are books written by Confederates going to be removed from from the public libraries?
The Galt House has a marker that refers to President Grant, a slave owner, will that also be removed?
Will the name of Jefferson county be changed, Jefferson owned hundreds of slaves. 12 Presidents owned slaves, will every mention of them in public be wiped away?
When will these special interest groups be sated?
I know these are questions and not suggestions but I do hope the Mayor is at least asking himself these questions. It won't stop with Confederate artifacts and memorials, it will spread to religious symbols in public and any other thing someone feels offended by.    "
40299,"I think we could bring together the sides of the debate by instead of tearing down the monuments, we should erect much larger monuments where space allows, that dwarf and / or partially envelope the Confederate statues, partially hidddn inside.  These new monuments will exclusively be representative of equality, racial harmony, and show how brutal and horrific slavery was, and how it has left scars that still bleed today.  This solution will not sanitize the past, but will show painful lessons learned in our country's history.  If there is not enough room to do this at the sites where they currently exist, they should be moved nearby to receive the new artist's work, that symbolically overshadows the old, without destroying (read-forgetting) it.  "
40059,"I encourage you to remove Castleman from the horse. The horse can stay, but not the bigot who advocated for the segregation of our Olmsted Parks. In all seriousness I do think there is a place for these monuments, but only in a museum where adequate facts can be shared as to the horrors they stood and fought for. I feel this way about all monuments that glorify advocates of slavery. Thank you for allowing the community to comment. "
40242,"tonight I am sick and not feeling like writing a lot so I am going to share comments I made and shared.  Might be redundant in some places but you will understand.
, this man served in both armies as a general, the only man to do so. The USA army asked him to join after the war and after he was pardoned. If you go to the horse show at the fair, this man is the one who was very influential with the Saddlebred horses, his family raised them. I have done a lot of research on this man, need to do more and always wanted to write a book. When he died, men who served under him attended his funeral, CSA on one side the USA on the other and each had a service for him. He was very well respected by both. He was sent to Puerto Rico to help stop the Civil War there and served as the adjutant General for several years when he was called back to Kentucky to stop a civil war here after Gov. Goebel was killed after only a few days in office. He graduated from the University of Louisville School of Law in 1868. He was a successful business man after leaving the service.

From the internet:
He revived the Louisville Legion, a militia unit, in 1878 and became adjutant general of Kentucky in 1883, after the assassination of Gov Goebel.  The unit became the 1st Kentucky Volunteers in the Spanish–American War, and Castleman was commissioned a colonel in the U.S. Army. His unit participated in the invasion of Puerto Rico, and after the war he was promoted to brigadier general and served as military governor of the island.

Castleman never ran for office, but his military and business reputation gave him considerable influence. As a Delegate to the 1892 Democratic National Convention, he successfully lobbied for the nomination of Grover Cleveland. After Governor William Goebel was shot in 1900, Castleman was again appointed adjutant general of Kentucky and helped avoid conflicts in the fallout of the assassination.
In Louisville, he had great influence as Commissioner of the Board of Parks for over 25 years, during which time he helped establish Louisville's Olmsted Park system, which spurred development in various parts of Louisville and became one of the city's prized possessions over the next century.
He donated land for Tyler park and in the highlands for Cherokee and Seneca parks.
The monument: he founded the American Saddlebred Horse Association, he is seen in civilian clothing rather than military garb. The horse which Castleman rides on the statue was based on his beloved mare, Carolina.
The Castleman statue in Louisville should not be removed. It is not a confederate monument. It is in appreciation to a man who did a lot for this city. If this statue is removed, the horse show at the fair should be canceled. The parks system here, destroy them, he helped with attracting Olmsted to this city. The government...wrap it all up and start over, he helped with the early city. John B Castleman is not in a confederate uniform, he is in civilian clothes. Don’t forget D Boone killed Indians, maybe we should get rid of that one too. Ah yes, rename Jefferson Co...TJ was a slave holder and banish his statue and rename Louisville, I am sure we can find something that Louis XVI did. Oh while we are at it, both the owners of Locust Grove and Farmington owned slaves

I have done research on this man for several years...I have two replies for this...#1 is short and sweet The Castleman statue in Louisville should not be removed. It is not a confederate monument. It is in appreciation to a man who did a lot for this city. If this statue is removed, the horse show at the fair should be canceled. The parks system here, destroy them, he helped with attracting Olmsted to this city. The government...wrap it all up and start over, he helped with the early city. John B Castleman is not in a confederate uniform, he is in civilian clothes. Don’t forget D Boone killed Indians, maybe we should get rid of that one too. Ah yes, rename Jefferson Co...TJ was a slave holder and banish his statue and rename Louisville, I am sure we can find something that Louis XVI did. Oh while we are at it, both the owners of Locust Grove and Farmington owned slaves...Washington owned slaves as we as a lot of our early presidents. US Grant owned slaves...Robert E Lee did not.
Iin 1916, Castleman wrote, “We have inexcusably neglected to provide recreation grounds for our negro fellow citizens,” implying that none of the existing parks were for African Americans. “These people are citizens,” he condescended. “The same right that induces our liberal provision for their separate education should impel us to provide for them separate recreation grounds.”
Four years after Castleman died the city built the 61-acre Chickasaw Park as a consolation prize “for the use of negroes.”  The remaining Olmsted parks weren’t re-integrated until after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 1954. 
We often look back at people like Castleman and shrug and say “ah, well, he was a man of his time.” Perhaps that’s true. But there’s also something timeless about greed and self-dealing; about ignorance and intolerance. 

And yes, he and every confederate was a man of their times, the system was passed down from generation to generation...they didn't know any other way of life. If we are going to remove Castleman's statue, remove D Boone he killed American Indians, remove Thomas Jefferson downtown, rename Jefferson Co. Jefferson was a slave owner. Rename and close Locust Grove and Farmington, they were both slave plantations. It is history, it is not a history we are proud of and have learned from the past. The Founding Fathers could have ended this all themselves and declared slavery unlawful...but they didn't, Alex Hamilton wanted to declare it illegal...the other Founding Fathers owned slaves, many of the early presidents did, I guess we should just throw every statue of them out also. Slavary was a common practice since the British Colonial days in American...""Anthony Johnson (b. c. 1600 – d. 1670) was a black Angolan who achieved freedom in the early 17th-century Colony of Virginia after serving his term of indenture. He became one of the first property owners and slaveholders of African birth there. Held as an indentured servant in 1621, he earned his freedom after several years, and was granted land by the colony."" ""Johnson was captured in his native Angola by an enemy tribe and sold to Arab slave traders. He was eventually sold as an indentured servant to a merchant working for the Virginia Company"" via the internet. He bought and sold slaves.
He did not cause segregation in the parks in reality...there was already segregation in every thing. He did write that the blacks should have their own parks, 4 years after his death Chicasaw Park was opened.

Did you know Robert E Lee did not own slaves? Almost every Founding Father did, almost every early President did. It was a common practice...is it not a common practice now to appose it? We cannot judge people whose shoes we have not walked in. Alex Hamilton was against slavery and wanted to abolish it but he was silenced by the other Founding Fathers. We have learned from our mistakes, ,well most of us have and they were the mistakes of our ancestors. As noted, Castleman is not in military garb but in Civilian clothes

It would be a shame and I am against removing any of the statues or anything else I have mentioned. I am not a racist but I love what made our city."
40205,i think statues of people who were part of the Confederacy should be left as they are; they are part of American history and descendants of these people live all around us today
40299,"Mr. Mayor,
Please Sir, take away these symbols of hate.  It may have been who we were but it is not who we aspire to be."
40207,"Removal of any art in order to spare ones feelings is ignorant. As a mother to 4, I am shocked that this is even an issue. 150 years and no one's batted an eye, then 2016 hit and all of a sudden these art forms turned racist. All this race baiting bullshit needs to stop. It is tearing this country apart. As a working, taxpaying citizen of this city, I will be very disappointed to see another piece of HISTORY leave this city! Use the funds to remove instead to educate that the Cival War was not only about slavery!!"
40299,
40217,"I believe that any confederate memorabilia or hate-based public art should be immediately removed. My advice is to combine the removal of these statues with educational initiatives to teach people of all ages about the history of race relations and the Civil War. This way opposers cannot argue history is being ""erased."" I want to live in a city where the Confederacy is not honored, and I don't want my neighbors of color to have to pass these symbols of hate on their daily lives. "
40203,"I'm a Louisville native, artist, educator, and business owner. I'm always doing everything I can to get other professional artists and educators to move to this area, and regularly attend art-based conferences and organizational meetings across the country. It's a big deal for cities to address the history and social implications of their public art, particularly dismantling and storing (not just moving!) statues and monuments dedicated to those involved with the Confederacy. Look at New Orleans for an example- the mayor stood up and spoke clearly and eloquently about the history of monuments in the city -!: the fact that some created unsafe spaces for citizens of color. Please do the research and take down the monuments that support a false history of, and therefore venerate, the story of the Confederacy within our city. They don't represent history - they represent the retelling and sanitization of violence, slavery, and anti-Americanism. Work with local and national artists to eventually replace them to memorialize all the amazing women and men who have lived in this city and made positive change for all Louisvillians. There are many to be considered! Thank you. "
40204,Any tribute to any person or era related to oppression or genocide needs to be taken down and locked up in a hate museum. Take. Them. Down. This is such a small price but will mean so much to the communities destroyed by them. 
40204,"I think the key is if the purpose of the piece is to honor bigotry, racism and/or slavery.  I think if the piece is honor to the confederacy then it is inappropriate.   Some are complicated though.  The Castleman statue for example.  While he was an officer in the confederate army, he was pardoned by Lincoln and served as a General for the US.  He then was a successful businessman in Louisville and played a major role in the development of our park system including donating land.  The statue he is wearing civilian clothes and riding his favorite horse.  I feel the purpose of the statue was to honor his contributions to our city.  I do not think the purpose was to honor the confederacy.  I would leave the Castleman statue alone, but people need to be educated about his contributions to Louisville.  Perhaps a new plaque explaining that.  Perhaps delete the part about him being an officer int he confederate army.  "
40217,"Take down the Castleman statue please! Louisville is a growing and diverse city which aims to be compassionate, and a Confederate solider who used guerrilla tactics who also contributed to the segregation of our parks is not the type of person we should honor with a statue."
40220,"Good idea mayor.  Have fun!

Criterion.  Look at the sculpted items only?

Look at the artist.  Is it a mass produced piece?  I like spectacular art.  Individuals style counts for more.  There is one lady sculptor from the Victorian era and she did many sculptures in the south.  If one of those is in the city possession... Wow.  
Try to keep.

Boone may represent a controversy.  
Muhammad Ali as well.

Bigger items should have more staying power.

Is the subject one of the fallen?   

Is the piece actually covering a grave?  protect that.

Is it in a battlefield?  Cairns count too.  Mounds.  Keep these.

Is there a public record?  

Is it an individual who provides a"" profile in courage""

Is it of someone who has made a mark in the community?  is there a report or finding written?

Artifacts as art.  Some captured weaponry may be on display.    Some is Federal property.  I doubt much of it represented in city collections.

Protect grounds from pot hunters and metal detector detractors.

Archeology and architecture: the city owns a camp Taylor property at Joe creson park.  And there are foundations all over in the area.  They should be protected.

I like symbolic and modern art too.  

I like the idea that a Hiroshima park could be here.  

I can see a federal corral monument near the downs would commemorate the union significance of Louisville.

I can see a monument to the river class river steamer call Louisville.  A museum of the western theater .  

I can see labor relations and progressive era people getting someone upset.  I have a nominee in that.

What about embarrassing things like lawn jockeys?

What about performance art?  blackface performance?

Civic art may need to include health professional commemorations.  Some of those pertain to the civil war as well.

I would require that some kind of balance happen.  Preserve a confederate then build a union monument too.  Brisbin is a favorite of mine.

   





"
40204,"I agree we should look at  public art and clean it up. I am talking about all the tagging or gang painting we see everywhere it is offending me.   Clean it up and cleanup the city, cut the parks grass and leave history alone. The past can't be changed,  seems we are on track to remove history classes from schools."
40220,Leave the art alone. 
40208,Thank you for this platform to voice my opinion. I feel that public Confederate monuments and Confederate flags are inappropriate and I do not want my tax dollars to pay for the upkeep of these monuments in particular. I feel these symbols glorify individuals that fought for the cause of perpetuating slavery in America. I am offended by them and I know that others are too. I wish that the city would take them down. Thank you. 
40223,"Will we stop at statues and monuments?  What about Locust Grove which was a slave plantation, are we going to bull doze it down?  Then there are all the slave walls built throughout the state, are we going to tear those down?  This is a slippery slope.  We cannot erase the past by tearing down monuments, and historical locations.  Men with more wisdom than I have said if you do not learn history your are likely to repeat it.  Vietnam was not a popular war and the veterans were treated like garbage when they returned.  Are we going to tear down those monuments next? Martin Luther King did not support gay marriage are we going to take down monuments of him.  Are we going to get rid of Martin Luther King Blvd.  Will we start tearing down statues of Thomas Jefferson because he owned slaves.  The list just keep growing until there is nothing left.  As I have said it is a slippery slope and a knee jerk reaction to something much larger.  As long as men like George Soro's are providing billions of dollars in activist funding this might become something none of us will be proud that we were a participant."
40214,I believe anything having to do with the confederacy needs to be removed from government property. They belong in museums or displays showing the horrible history that almost destroyed our country. Absolutely nothing to honor or celebrate
40229,"Remove them. I don't care what is done with them, but let's not glorify monsters."
40291,"Get rid of confederate statues.

But what art will replace them. It seems like there's no statues honoring the past, only the civil war. Don't trash them. Remove to a place where they can be preserved.  Other than the Lincoln statue by the library what do we have?

It is a shame we honor those responsible for racism and slavery and not true heroes."
40245,"Should we honor Robert E. Lee?  He was a great military strategist, a leader of men, intelligent, compassionate, brave, and morally upright.  For all of these things he should be considered a role model.  Except, he offered himself and all of these attributes in defense of the Confederacy.  Robert E. Lee was not a bad man- he was a very good man who was very wrong about a most fundamental issue- the value and dignity of all people regardless of race.  The problem with General Lee is that he owes his fame entirely to his defense of the indefensible.  There are thousands or hundreds of thousands of intelligent, compassionate, brave, and moral leaders of men and women in American history who are not and never have been honored with statues, paintings, theses, movies, books or songs- many of whom do not have the black mark of the Confederacy on them.  Why are they not similarly immortalized?  Because they do not have Lee’s fame.

What about George Washington?  Everything that we have said about Lee’s character may be said of Washington- and like Lee he owned slaves.  Should we also remove tributes and memorials of this man from the public sphere?  No.  What is the difference?  Washington has significant faults, but they are not central to his fame and his contributions to our country.

We remember Lee and other Confederate figures because of their service to the Confederate cause, not in spite of it.  Unlike others who are thought to be great Americans, Confederates have no other greatness that should move us to honor them more than other good men.  Donate the memorials to a Civil War museum.
"
40222,"John Breckinridge Castleman is my great great great uncle on my fathers side. I obviously don't like seeing my ancestors being vandalized. However, I can understand why people are so angry right now. However, we cannot make blanket approaches to these monuments and memorials. Intent matters to. It must be some case by case. Why was it built? Who is the figure? 

History is full of complex historical figures that cannot just be placed into simple categories of good and evil. That kind of thinking only leads to a completely ignorant and uneducated society. General Grant had slaves and he was commander of the Union army, so what does that make him?

That being said, after reviewing the historical information about Castleman, maybe it's time it came down. Information that has been made known suggests he was more than what we he was originally. He was a segregationist. That is something that goes against everything I believe in and can certainly be seen as offensive to many including some of my friends. Perhaps the fact that that part of him which was glossed over is what white supremacy or systematic racism is. 

We cannot just wash over the ugly parts of our history by removing memories of it because it makes offended. I still think there are much more important issues, like the increase of hate groups. But, we should be appreciating, celebrating, and building monuments and memorials that bring unity to people. 

If Castleman must come down, he must. I only hope he is put somewhere else because I don't think the protests and vandalism are gonna stop."
40218,"Keep the statues , leave history be . Democrats want to erase history so we don't know what side they were on & how the democrats wanted to keep slavery while conservatives wanted to abolish slavery . Removing the statues won't change or erase history "
40272,"the statues and art has been around hundreds of years if not longer, and it has not bothered any one until obama started this race war and if it keeps happening you leaders will be the cause of it . if people dont like the statues or art then dont look at it . first some had problems with a cross then the flag now statues what will be next. if you all keep removing stuff that some find offensive them remove from both side. The statue of the confederate soldiers died in this country for what they thought was right at for their time and now because of some so called cry babies find them racist they all have to go. these people was not slaves we was not slave owner, the soldiers died and it was not over slavery. you all are about to cause a civil war in this day and age if this is not stopped . yes i am white and i am not a racist but i do take pride in where i come from and it is from the south and that includes those confederate soldiers  statues and flags despite what some thing those things have meaning to some and it is not about racism. grow a back bone and do right for all people never mind with the PC crap we are fed up with it and you all"
40229,"These statues have been in place for how many years? They just became a problem when? Now ask why they became a problem. To be honest, I'm 44 years old, lived in Louisville all my life and never knew of the statue that was removed by U of L or the one by Cherokee Triangle or any others that might be around. None of us that are alive today had anything to do with the Cival War or Slavery, did our ancestors, most of them probably yes. That is the past, none of us can change it. Now these idiotic White Supremacists, KKK, etc., Black Lives Matter, etc. I don't agree with their beliefs, violence, etc. Where are the marches and protest every time there is a murder, there are more violence and deaths between themselves than anything else. Also their stupid codes of silence or snitches, etc. so they kill someone else to get revenge so it never ends. The money you would have to spend to remove statues and art needs to be spent on other things. There is also a REAL possibility that we could go to War with North Korea, so everyone needs to get their priorities straight!"
40215,"I believe symbols matter and greatly influence our civil life.  Statutes and other forms of public art are such symbols. Given this, we should, indeed must endevour to put forth only symbols which encourage and inspire good and decent ideals.  I fully support removing negative symbols to a location in which they can be viewed only as historical artifacts rather than as devices that foster strife and discord, meanness and inhumaneness.  

Public art gives a city esthetic appeal as well, and are often located so as to give shape and texture to public spaces. Therefore I think the city should stand ready to replace removed inappropriate edifices with more suitable and appealing ones so as to avoid the loss of otherwise valuable public spaces.  "
40219,"I believe that all statutes honoring political or military officers of the Confederacy should be removed from public spaces and placed in museums where they belong. Statues in public spaces are for honoring individuals, not just remembering history. Confederate statues and memorials should not be on Louisville public property."
40203,Now is the time to remove the statues honoring the wrong side of history. Let them be remembered in our history books as the traitors and foes of the United States that they were. We shouldn't have to see them in a place of honor and public display. Let's move on already.
40219,I realize people will say it is a part of history but not here in Louisville. We were with the union and we are a democratic city so I suggest putting them in a confederate cities history museum where they can be reminded that they lost!
40216,"Up until today anything goes for art. NOW we want to censor art. Im old enough to have studied the NAZIs and this is exactly the mindset of the NAZI and current day ISIS . If the art doesn't agree with the politics then lets destroy the Art. 

If you look up (racism) the word itself comes from the NAZI.  It is meant to divide and thanks to this administration we are becoming a city divided. Im sure we will sanitize our art to the demise of the city.  No Lawn Jockeys because some Dumb uninformed person has not historical reference for the meaning and significance of  this . Go ahead show how stupid you are"
40206,"I welcome this review of public art. I wholeheartedly agree that pieces that represent, celebrate or evoke memories of bigotry of any kind, racism or slavery they should not be displayed in public places. History is one thing, but glorifying horrible history is quite another. Thank you Mayor Fisher and other city leaders who have opened this forum."
40212,"The United States of America is the only nation that tolerates such monuments to the greatest act of treachery in its history. A casual, liberal view of this implies that the USA is compellingly open and gracious. In the however likely or unlikely event these monuments may inspire or suborn further anti-American activity, the cost is simply too great to bear.

We the people have tolerated such revisionist monuments to treachery for nearly a century. That time has passed. Louisville is either an American city or a city of chaos and disruption. Louisville is either a place where race and class are incidental, or a place with monuments to White Power. I know how I see this city. I know why I returned after 21 years far away. We the people of Louisville, the residents, the native born, and those of us who have moved on, find such divisiveness alienating and disheartening.

Take them down. Today."
40229,"Leave our historical monuments alone. They have been in existence for years with no one giving them a second d glance. I beg you to pay attention to what really matters most Mr Mayor and it's not a historical piece of art. It cannot hurt anyone. But gun violence, drugs and horrible misjustice in our city is what really matters. Do something before our city finishes falling apart. I can hardly recognize it any more. By the way, let our police do their jobs without fear. That would certainly help crime and the murder rate. "
40204,"I support the removal and replacement of any monument that is directly related to the confederacy, protecting slave ownership,  or preventing the progression of civil rights. In our multicultural community, the placement of confederate soldiers or generals on a pedestal sends the message that we support state-sponsored discrimination. These monuments belong in a museum where their relevance can be taught and discussed in context, not in a celebratory public display."
40204,"Thanks to Trump, these public art pieces are now, unfortunately, potential sites for Nazi gatherings and therefore inevitable violence and death(s). It's honoring the history of the Confederacy vs. risking a 2nd Charlotteville here in Kentucky. This is a no-brainer."
40206,"Remove any and all Confederate ""art."" The Confederacy has it's place in history books and museums, not celebrated monuments. What message does that send to our children? Bring them all down! "
40229,"Do not touch our history.!!!
"
60611,"How encouraging!
Vitality and INTELLiGENCE.
There is hope,
Thank you"
40299,I think the art should stay. If not where does it stop? Changing names of schools? Buildings? Parks? Its all part of history. Everyone is offended by everything nowadays. 
,
40216,"Take down ANY and EVERYTHING that encompasses hate. Our Louisville needs to set an example of a City of Love. As a white, Christian, Grandmother, I want to see my Grand Children grow up here without the worry of KKK, Alt-right, Neo-Nazis, Ati-Muslim, Sexist, and any extreme group that represent hate and violence of ANY KIND. I also ask that you PLEASE don't ever give these groups a forum in our City, due to their extreme hate and violent  platforms.  Thank You. "
40217,"They should go. Monuments honor heroes and other above-average people. There's no excuse for honoring traitors, so they should not have been erected in the first place. Where are the Union statues?
The argument that we're trying to erase history is hogwash, as is the argument that the Civil War was not about slavery."
40223,"I agree with the Public Art review but I hope the citizenry gets a say in what stays and what goes. I do not believe we should bow to the alt-right or alt-left, but let the working man and woman-the voters-decide. I am for compromise and do realise some of these monuments would be a better fit at a museum or park. "
40272,"Those monuments  are  of AMERICANS, they should be remembered , it was a very hard time for  this country, and many good things came into being during this time, such as advances in medicine , advances in industry , it's not our right to judge these people, it was a different way of life at that time,we should always remember those brave people .stop the hate and be proud  of the country  we have become,  how can a statue  offend you?  It offends me that I even have to hear of such hate, I wonder how many of these protesters have done any research into the life and family's  of the monuments that they hate so much, they might see things a little differently if they did"
40208,"At issue are the reasons why a person is deemed worthy of recognition by a piece of public art, and the circumstances pertaining as to when they were so recognised. If the only or primary claim to fame for a person is their role in war (regardless of the side, and the causes) it seems a poor reason to commemorate them. This is less of an issue when the cause is unequivocally right (for the sake of argument, a WW2 figure), and more of an issue when the cause is dubious (e.g. states rights, when the particular right in question is the right to own human beings). Robert E Lee, to take one example, led a distinguished life after the Civil War as president of an institute of higher education. Were he to be remembered for his role in academia (necessarily out of uniform) there might be less objection to commemorating him. If the various persons commemorated in Louisville deserve commemoration for reasons other than their role as commanders in the civil war, and their depictions were similarly non-military, there might be less objection to their commemoration (not necessarily none, but reasoned debate could take place). If they are commemorated solely or primarily for their military role; and most importantly if their commemoration was instigated at a sensitive time and for transparently political reasons (e.g. raising the statue of a civil war figure deliberately, provocatively during the era of civil rights legislation) then there seems no justification for keeping that commemoration. The question of timing seems particularly pertinent. Funding, and raising enthusiasm for public works of art is a time consuming process. If a statue was erected, say, in 1960 after 60-80 years of fund-raising and approval-seeking it is not necessarily reasonable to suppose that its erection is designed to be purely or primarily provocative. A time-consuming process fo research would then be appropriate. If however, a statue were erected, say, in 1960, after a short period of consideration, it might be supposed that the reasons for its erection were primarily provocative; which would make arguments for its immediate removal (without necessarily offering it to some spurious approving entity) the more compelling. Good luck. People will complain whatever you decide."
40217,Louisville needs to take down all confederate statues and any additional iconography. Let's step into the 21st century and create a city for all of us
,"Our community should not preserve places of honor for people who hold racist views.  The Lincoln statue on the Waterfront must be removed, and the bridge must be renamed.  Please see the Lincoln quote and article below for reference.  Thank you.

""While I was at the hotel to-day, an elderly gentleman called upon me to know whether I was really in favor of producing a perfect equality between the negroes and white people. While I had not proposed to myself on this occasion to say much on that subject, yet as the question was asked me I thought I would occupy perhaps five minutes in saying something in regard to it. I will say then that I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the black and white races -- that I am not nor ever have been in favor of making VOTERS or jurors of negroes, NOR OF QUALIFYING THEM HOLD OFFICE, nor to intermarry with white people; and I will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which I believe will forever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality. And inasmuch as they cannot so live, while they do remain together there must be the position of superior and inferior, and I as much as any of her man am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race.""

-Abraham Lincoln

Our community should not preserve places of honor for people who hold racist views.  The Lincoln statue on the Waterfront must be removed, and the bridge must be renamed."
40220,They should have come down long before now. Please let Louisville be on the right side of history by removing them. We should set an example for the rest of our state.
40215,"Just stop! Do not erase history, good or bad! It's a piece of history and how can we learn from the past if we destroy it!!!
Don't you realize you will never please everyone! Our cities have much greater issues on it's plate than to spend time and resources like this."
40258,"There is no place in our city or our country for monuments,  statues, flags, etc. honoring  bigotry, racism, and or slavery. "
40203,"The Civil War was fought because the Confederates wanted to maintain their ability to own other human beings.  We should not keep monuments honoring people who believed they can own other human beings.  Removing these statues is not attempting to erase our history.  We would be righting the wrong of honoring slave owners.  If we are going to claim to be a compassionate city, we should think about how these monuments impact African Americans.  What does it say to our children we would honor people who were traitors to our country so that they could maintain slavery. "
40205,"Art that depicts people or events from the Civil War, that celebrates the Confederates in any way, should be removed. I, personally, am supportive of their being destroyed, but I understand that historians may want to preserve them. These art items celebrate the worst time in our country's history. At a time when bigotry, racism and hate have escalated due to actions and inactions by our president, it seems a perfect time to fight this at a local level. As a city, state, and nation, I wish we could stand together and agree that there is no place for hateful symbols in our communities. 

Our city has a budget to care for our public art. Let's use that funding to take care of those pieces which we all agree we treasure and appreciate. New pieces that are acquired should celebrate the best of us. "
40212,I personally believe you should leave our artwork and confederate soldier statues alone because they are a part of History. There is a lot of things that I don't want to hear or see and what I know is I don't look or I don't listen. People need to stop using color and the past as an excuse for how they feel or what they do. Communist countries dictate what you see & here & we are not a communist country we are America & Americans the land of the free. As my son said are we going to be tearing the pyramids down or as President Trump said are we going to be tearing down Washington statue because he was a slave owner! Let's stop this insanity there is no way you are ever going to please everyone. Let the Museum's & the Arts Center's do what they do. Let the statues stay where they are if it offends somebody they can move away from it because it was definitely there before them. 
40059,"I love art and history and fervently hope there is no destruction of Louisville's statues. The sudden intolerance of these works will not change history nor the hearts of bigots.  Displaced aggression? Why are they only now abhorred? I dont look at Daniel Boone as a reminder of all the Native Americans killed. Art is subjective. However, I can accept that there may be more appropriate venues for display. Dont rush into a decision.  "
40205,Please remove the castleman statue
40245,"If you're going to remove it, put it in a museum. Do not be coerced into ""Orwellian"" decisions. It's not about perpetuating shameful acts, it's about preserving the past and keeping an unbiased future. Offensive things have no place as a public memorial but it's still apart of American History and deserves to be preserved for sake of accuracy and avoiding a ""rose-colored"" depiction of what makes us great. Making mistakes and consequently correcting mistakes is whats fueled our greatness. Erasing our mistakes is not only showing a lack of integrity but dangerous to everyone's future.

Additionally this subject is an incredibly subjective one. This is a prime example of if you try to please everyone, you'll end up pleasing no one. The responsible thing to do is take them down and preserve them elsewhere where their viewing is voluntary and not in broad daylight so to speak. Be mindful of the fact both sides of this argument involve American citizens. Regardless of whether you're regressive left, alt-right, lover, hater, bigot, or have acceptance  for everyone, everyone's voice should be heard and accounted for, not just the ones we deem unoffensive or we agree with. A bigot is still perfectly capable of having a valid point. A fanatic is still capable of having a valid point. Please stay mindful."
40220,I believe we should leave our existing artworks of history and add to them more recent artworks of our history. Tearing down artwork is silly and pointless. I love our statues and think they beautiful works of art. Why not create new works of art that are just as beautiful?
40222,"I believe our memorial statues and monuments should remain.  They are a reminder of our past history - good and bad.  Thomas Jefferson had slaves and our county is named for him. Should his statue be removed?  The generals who fought in the Civil War for the Confederacy  had served many years in the Union army.  After the war, they were granted amnesty by the President.  Most of the people fighting as Confederates were not slave owners.  They were for the most part farmers, brothers fighting brothers.  I am a genealogist and history fanatic.  Change plaques but leave the monuments."
40204,"For the statue on a Cherokee Road (Castleman?) is it enough to change the accompanying plaque to recognize his true contribution to Louisville (our amazing park system) and maybe mention this contribution was AFTER he had renounced the confederacy, rather than simply speaking to his participation in the Confederacy?

As abhorrent as it is, the Confederacy is part of Kentucky's history - it's not pretty, but eliminating all recognition of our role seems to be perpetuation of revisionist history/whitewashing/glossing over of the truth. More important to Louisville in the long run was his legacy of the beautiful, well-utilized park system, rather than his participation in the Confederate revolt (something that more Kentuckians participated than any of might like to acknowledge). As someone who supports the BLM movement, I appreciate the conflicting views of others, but I'm far more concerned with the statue of Jefferson Davis in OUR STATE CAPITOL than I am the presence of a well-loved statue at the entrance to the crown jewel of Louisville's park system."
,"Public city art should be a positive reflection or depiction of the people and environment in that city. Sore loser outdated confederates didn't build the south, slaves did most of the work. Maybe all those confederate and soldier statues could be donated to a history museum where people who want to see (who fought and lost) can see them.
With so much negativity happening in our society today, the public visual art should be something that makes the passers by feel better after seeing it, or at least NOT something that is only for a select few to remember a history of oppression and segregation."
40206,Please remove the statue. 
40216,I believe all confederate monuments should be removed. They are a symbol of oppression and treason. 
40299,This is over-reaching government. If you start this....where does it stop? 
40212,  I am against statues or other items being removed simply because people are offended. Many things offend me but I am told to get over it. History is what it is. Removing reminders does not change it but it will increase the hate. Do you love ISIS when you see them destroy historic items? I am sure they are offended too. But destroying these things do not change the way history has happened. Learn from history. Not try to hide it.
40272,What has gotten in to these people that want history and art removed? Now our Mayor wants to review art? This is downright crazy. Put it out for a vote on the next ballot.
40214,"Statues of confederate soldiers need to be taken down. They are a disgusting reminder of the oppression and enslavement of an entire race, and serve as monuments to treasonous traitors. 

This fine city, which is often a beacon of hope, needs to serve as an example and eradicate these symbols of white supremacy and hatred. "
40299,"My thoughts are if the piece of art is honoring bigotry, racism or slavery in any form- then take it down. Thank you for allowing our thoughts on this matter. "
40272,"I cannot understand why at this particular moment in time that everybody feels so offended by a statue that has been standing for years. People indicate that they represent slavery. Maybe they did, but this is history. Whether it be good or bad, it's history. 
To dismantle and teardown statues or buildings that were built in remembrance of civil war heroes, whether they're from the North or the South, is just a way to hide history. Why do you want to HIDE history? Is this the way to help the people forget our history?
I feel any likenesses or statues of Muhammad Ali should be removed as to the fact of this individual not standing up for his country, showing people, you can be a traitor and be praised.
PLEASE leave what is alone. "
40205,"I believe monuments which glorify the Confederacy or a person's service to the Confederacy or the causes it stood for should be removed from public places. It is important, though, never to forget, so It may be well to place them in settings where they can be used as historical reminders of the evils of that time or the racism that caused them to be erected long after the war.   Their continued presence in places of honor in our communities only serves to perpetuate then crimes and injustice of earlier times."
40255,Let's thoughtfully begin to fill space with current reflections of the truth. Remove the statues that cause suffering and perpetuate a myth. Redefine power. Celebrate love and goodness. Energize a meaningful conversation. Thank you.
40272,"A museum sounds good to me.  One that will balance the Confederate with the Union, or the Confederates with the slaves.  
What about the Frazier museum?  Could it expand to include this?

Thank you."
40228,"Think this pandering to radical liberal sjw s needs to stop. Been a dem for 28yrs and this type of stuff needs to stop. By overwhelmingly majority of the people who are protesting are white? How silly is this? If mayor Fisher thinks the monument is so wrong why didn't he say something two years ago before we spent over $200,000 on restoring it? Think it's time to replace Mayor Fisher. We need common sense leadership not another radical liberal trying to get more national tv spots. 
If were you believe in removing symbols of racism then you should be removing Planned Parenthood and all Democrat offices if you know thier history. 
Didn't that sound stupid? If so, why can't you apply the same logic to the monuments? 
As a 28yr registered democrat in Louisville,  I think it's time to find a new leader with the use of unbiased common sense leadership we have been accustomed to. "
40204,"Please leave our history alone. It would be the biggest waste of money ever. People have lost their minds, seems like it just anything to stir up trouble. They have been there for decades with no trouble. Please throw the book at the vandals."
49165,I believe this art is part of our history and should remain. Ther will always be the good the bad and the ugly here in America. We need to stop trying to erase history. 
40206,"The statue should be changed. Why we didn't eradicate every trace of the confederacy in the US as in Germany post WW2 was because we had to live peacefully amongst our former enemies after the war. If you study reconstruction you realize that the nation never arrived at a ""mission accomplished"" moment, instead the nation wanted to entirely put the war behind them and left many issues open ended. We are dealing with these same open ended issues that we've struggled with since the Declaration of Independence was signed. 

Specifically with Gen. Castleman, a thorough reading of history is required. Check out his memoirs: Active Duty (its online for free). I think we should work with the Filson Historical Society to design a new statue that does not feature the general. "
40206,"A statue that honors slavery, a core part of what the confederacy stood for, has no place in a compassionate community. The time has come to take it down.
Thank you for listening."
40218,There's no reason to glorify bigotry and hate. 
40217,"Merriam-Webster defines a momument as ""a lasting evidence, reminder, or example of someone or something notable or great; a distinguished person."" Monuments, by their very definition, are problematic when they exult a member of society from the past who did not represent the goals of American democracy and freedom. As an officer within the Confederate Army during the Civil War, John Breckinridge Castleman was on the wrong side of history. While history cannot (and SHOULD NOT) be re-written or erased, to celebrate these figures in monument form goes against the foundations of freedom and equality for all people that our country was founded on. Regardless of political affiliation, individuals who do not support the goals of a free society should not be raised above citizens, to be admired and praised. As a historian, I strongly reject the notion that individuals calling for the removal of such monuments are trying to re-write history. On the contrary, a quick glance at how post-WWII Germany handled its history teaches us much about how these moments of our history should be handled. Germany has not shirked away from its responsibility in the slaughter of millions of innocent individuals in the name or racism. Indeed, the monuments to innocents and the museums documenting the cruel and sick behaviors of Nazis reminds the nation and the world every day of what those on the wrong side of history are capable of. But you're sure as hell not going to see a statue of Hitler or Goebbels on the streets of Berlin. Rather than praising these men, they need to be put in context as enablers of racially-motivated violence. If anything, our society needs to be more educated, and that doesn't happen through these monuments. I would strongly urge Mayor Fischer and members of the Louisville Commission on Public Art to consider the implications of raising these individuals as notable or great in our history, and instead find other ways of giving context to their lives. I am at your service if my background as a historian can be of any help.

40204,"We had 30 thousand from KY fight for the confederacy, 80 thousand fight for the union. After the war, 72 confederate monuments erected in KY and a mere 4 monuments for the union. Do you see the problem? Ihe not art.  Its white supremacy telling blacks that they are subhuman.  Take it down "
40214, It's been there for over a 100 years. Leave it alone. It's just part of our history. If you take it down then take down king louis downtown too. Hell change the name of the city too. 
40272,"In response to the removal of historic statues:

Dear Gov. Matt Bevin,

The monuments you disagree of taking down contradict your statement that hate from both sides are wrong and unacceptable. Those statues are founded upon a time in our history that was fueled by nothing less than the very hate you speak of. Today they are glorified trophies of the pain inflicted upon those very people who were forced to be here in that time period and to do what was told to them AND if they acted with any resistance they were beaten while bound, raped, demeaned in the public eye, harassed, and all too often killed for noncompliance.  

You speak of standing together when in reality there is no talk of how! Myself, as an educated white woman who is madly in love with my best friend who is black and more educated than I, could never imagine how these statues are such a symbolic need. I am ashamed of what my ancestors did to people with HATE in their hearts. I am hurt that the only difference between the oppressed and those who held the ""control"" was something so superficial as the color of one's skin. 

I refuse to allow ""white supremacist"" to have anyone in my family to walk around with fear in their hearts; this includes my bi-racial children who have exemplified nothing less than love for any soul they have encountered. They are innocent, they are beautiful and they pass no judgement. Maybe if we looked at the world on superficial things as if we were looking through the eyes of children it would be easier. 

In reference the the control of those ""in"" power... the words hate and prejudice do not need to flow from your mouth as your actions speak volumes in itself. 

Sincerely, 
Amanda K. Mills

40206,"The idea of moving items that are deemed offensive is better than doing nothing, but not much better. It seems to me that those items need to be destroyed or perhaps recycled into an art form that represents the inclusive city that we aspire to be.  Moving them isn't a solution, wherever there are displays that glorify the confederacy or the people who supported it, they will be offensive. "
40216,Leave art alone. Leave our history intact stop trying to change the past to appease the angry mob. You can't reflect on how far we have come as a nation of free people if you keep trying to hide the past. 
,Pent up political anger is fueling the protesting & demands to take down historical monuments. Should the confederate historical highway markers be removed & graves be exhumed in Cave Hill? Tone down the rhetoric and lead to quell mob mentality. Political correct has become a religion.
40026,"Louisville is named after Louis XVI

The Fleur de lis  is the personal symbol of Louis XVI   Louie was not just a slave owner, but he codified slavery in France and the French Colonies. One of the largest Grench Colonies was the French owned center on North America.  This area ultimately became part of the United States with the Louisiana Purchase. 

Most of Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Kansas and 9 other states were slave states because of Louisville's namesake. 

ShouldvLouisville be named Louisville, and using such a racist symbol to represent the city. "
40299,"Castleman by Cherokee Park should be removed, put in the Frazier museum and replaced with President Trump on the horse. Thank you for listening and considering this idea. I frequently visit the area with my big white dog Toby. It would put a smile on my face."

40215,"What if, instead of removing monuments with links to slavery, we erected complementary monuments nearby (within sight of the old monuments, and of a similar size) that commemorate the victims of slavery specific either to the person being honored in the confederate statue, or to victims of unfair treatment specific to the location of the monument...or even a general memorial. Probably a more expensive option, but one that would honor a more complete view of history instead of just erasing it. The Mayor's Office could ask local minority groups to contribute ideas for specific monuments both at that location and at others around the city to even the story a bit."
42701,"KEEP them! They should remain in the public eye as a conversation price... art should not be defaced but it should provoke emotions. 

Stop trying to hide our history we are founded on."
40205,"Thank you for providing a forum to comment on the public art that represents bigotry, racism, anthe oppression of black persons and the exploitation of their bodies. I ask that the statues, specifically Castleman, representing these ideologies be removed from public spaces and placed in museums or other historical areas/buildings. "
40214,"Leave things alone. Once you start removing things that may offend someone where does it stop. These monuments, statues, art pieces are just objects. "
40206,"Great art always offends.  Study impressionism.  Study Stravinsky. Art should always be free to offend anyone, it's all right by the first amendment.  If I can tolerate Jesus Christ in a vat of urine that was called ""art"", you can tolerate a Confederate soldier or two.  "
42718,"Please do not follow the PC crowd by destroying any more symbols of our heritage.  I know that Ricky Jones is dancing in the streets, but let's not give him any more music to dance to.  These symbols have stood for many years without any problem, so why now?  We have become a country of lemmings with the minority telling the majority what to do. That's wrong.  All of these statues  are works of art.  In one short paragraph I cannot tell you how upset and sad that all of this destruction makes me."
40204,History is for museums. Monuments are to honor. We should not honor bigotry. 
40204,"I went to WDRB website tonight because they announced that the Mayor had a site set up for comments on Public art.  The ""Click here"" did not work on that WDRB website--""message Website not found""  I stumbled upon this.

There were hundreds of intelligent comments on Nextdoor Cherokee Triangle today and yesterday.  The mayor could get a very good evaluation of sentiment in the area on the controversy  of the Castleman monument, if he would join Nextdoor and review thesite, probably better than the forms to be filled out.  I personally am for keeping all monuments that represent history, regardless of whether you approved of the characters etc.  I am so enamored with some cities that I have visited where there is an abundance of beautiful pieces of art (statues) and fountains throughout it.  I was appalled by removal of the Confederate monument on  So. third.  I would hope that it will be replaced by some piece of art .   I do not believe in allowing a small group of radicals to dominate public opinion.  "

40219,"Please explain to me and everyone else why BLACK LIVES MATTER IS allowed to take my American heritage and destroy it? You are approving this and making it possible! What the hell am I supposed to tell my kids? Sorry we can't talk about the History of the United States because BLACK LIVES MATTER has decided to erase it all. This is extremely disrespectful to every soldier and their families who fought for this country and it's freedom. I am so embarrassed to call you the Mayor of Louisville.  
I mean let's get serious if you take these statues down and erase the civil war then slavery never happened either. Isn't this how it works?
Let it be and stop trying to people please! You are just complying with whatever Black Lives MATTER wants so they don't make a fuss and do more stuff. Well here is a lesson in life for you; Let people be mad, you will never please everyone all day everyday. You can not just erase history because some people are complaining.  They earned their right to complain because of the people in these statues! I could go on for days. You put an abundance of bike lanes in but don't fix the roads. You have allowed police districts to be over ran with officers who are exhausted and put in the line of danger daily.  Hire more police. Stand up to those who want to change the History of our country!
Will not vote for you if these statues come down!"
40213,"Confederate soldiers are veterans if we take down these statues we should take down and change anything else that could be offensive to anyone.

Thomas Jefferson owned slaves yet we have a school named after him. The list goes on "

40299,"We have as a nation,have gone thru many difficult ,controversial and painful times but removing monuments erected to those times will not change a thing.If we begin that process we never know where it ends. I lived through the Vietnam era and served in that war,it was controversial,we had riots ,marches and even people died while protesting.will the day come when another politician decides that was a painful and dark day in America so let's remove all monuments related to that war. Thank you "
40203,"Monuments to ideals and values over which a civil war was waged to defeat have no place in publicly funded spaces. There is no liberty and justice for all in their continued dominating visual presence, no restoration of dignity to any whose history includes suffering under slavery and racism that the Civil War was required to end, and no honor to those who gave their lives so that all people in this country could be free AND equal. Failure to remove these memorials and exhaultations to the culture that extolled the virtues of exploiting an entire race of human beings for profit is inexcusable. Remove these monuments to hatred, or we will remove you from public service for your failure to act for the good of the people, ALL the people that you were elected to serve. 

Use these monuments to defeated warriors in a proper context to educate on the virtues AND perils of maintaining a society rich with the differences of our many cultures that come together under one nation, one which so many have given their lives to shape, preserve, and defend. Use these examples of our history to inform our future, as a means to recognize that we are all still enslaved, yet to corporate masters. Let this effort serve as an opportunity for our public art to reflect the importance and changing state of our lives, multiculture, and varied beliefs IN OUR TIME. 

Thank you. "
40205,"The few statues of the Confereracy that remain in the Metro Louisville area should be left as is. We also have the Ali Center that stands as a stark contrast and reminder of how far we have come and have to go. I only wish we had some monument in tribute to Sojourner Truth or the Underground Railroad.

In Wyoming, at Little Big Horn, stands a monument to Custer. Just north of it on the same battlefield is the beautiful monument erected as a tribute to Native Americans. The monuments are reminders of our flawed past and the future to which we should all strive to achieve; truth, justice, and peace."
,"If your going to take down one form of are, then take it all down. History is history and can't be changed.  All art is offensive to somebody.  What's next."
40203,"Leave the monuments alone,  it's all part of all of our history. Tearing them down, moving them doesn't change the past. But erasing the history of all of the citizens of Louisville will have long lasting impressions on future generations. This is our city,  and our history. Leave it where it stands!  This is a very slippery slope. And you can put the brakes on this madness here!"
40223,"Let's not forget that what is happening is sanitizing history.  What starts with removing statues of people important to the community can become removing reference to any people deemed inappropriate. Is this a proper course to pursue?
History gives us the ability to learn from mistakes and not repeat them.  Please don't start a fresh round of mistakes.   "
40229,"You cannot erase history.  Some are yelling that the white individuals depicted in these monuments owned slaves. What those individuals fail to also mention is that one of the first men to own slaves was in fact a black man. 

If we remove these monuments where does it stop? As someone online said:

""There is another site across town where the person being honored once said, ""A black man should be killed if he's messing with a white woman."" When the interviewer asked about black women crossing the color barrier, this person responded: ""Then she dies. Kill her, too.""   Any one want to guess who said that?   Look it up.  The greatest said it.  Mr. Ali.   And he has his own museum.   Should we close that down too?""

If we erase everything that offends someone we erase not only our history, but also our future. We erase everything and cease to exist. As a wise man once said..... Those that don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it. "
40059,"Suggest you start by eliminating the statue of king Louis and renaming the city as he was a tyrant many of whose subjects were no better than slaves. Then eliminate the statue of Thomas Jefferson and rename Jefferson county since he was not only a slave holder but seduced a slave into bearing his children. Finally eliminate the Muhammad Ali's statues and museum because honoring a draft dodger can be seen as  a stain on all veterans who answered the call.

Is the above enough proof of how stupid the whole effort is. Statues honor people's achievements or identify their place in our history. Shall we do like the Russians or others do and try to rewrite history to suit our current feelings? Statues are a form of art and should be placed in proper historical context; but  destroying them is no better than re-writing history.   

For example; being a child of WW2; I find Volkswagen a repugnant symbol of Nazi Germany; however I don't call for a ban on the vehicle or company nor would I protest a plant in Kentucky. One more example, I personally find Creation Park and the Ark a symbol of ignorance and bigotry; but I don't deny the right of those who believe to have a public expression of their beliefs(even though privately funded, the state spent several million dollars and tax breaks to assist the building of the 'statue/ark"") History is the past and can not be changed no matter how much we dislike or try to deny/hide  parts of it."
40206,"John B. Castleman.  Remove it. Remove any generals or ""confederate heroes.""   It's wrong to commemorate such things.  War isn't pretty or perfect, but there's a difference between a memorial with a list of names, a museum for education, and this garbage.    There are signs around the city of things like ""former slave pen""-- those are appropriate.  It's sad and sobering, but important.  But, statues of dead generals on horses who lost the war don't make any sense to teach and remember America's atrocities or the Civil War in general.  It's a fraud to think fondly on the civil war or on fighting for slavery as heroic.    "
40207,"As a life long Louisvillian and one who grew up passing this harmless statue, I am so disgusted with the rhetoric that is going on around the country as well as here in Louisville, Ky.  Colonel Castleman was not only a Confederate Colonel, but also served in the U.S. Army.  I've never looked at that statue and thought Confederate or Union.  I've always just seen him as a statue that is at one of the entrances of Cherokee Park and has been there for before I was born.  He is not wearing a Confederate uniform nor carrying a  Confederate flag.  He was a successful business man in Louisville at the turn of the century that donated land for a park and a philanthropist  Don't believe he owned slaves.  What's next erase Henery Clay from our states history?  Really?  History is very important.  It's a shame that schools don't do a very good job of teaching it any more.  The statue should stay exactly where it is!!"
40272,"Public art that seems to honor the confederacy have their place in history. If we take away our history, we are doomed to repeat it. However, history of negative events do not need to be in common areas, for every day view by our population. These statues need to be moved to museums or parks in designated spaces away from general walking paths/roads with markers telling the history of the statues."
40207,"I support the removal of all public displays of the Confederacy including statues, monuments, and the ""rebel flag"". It is important to me not to literally place a Confederate general or soldier on a pedestal to be immortalized. Louisville, and Kentucky, chose to remain in the United States and was instrumental to the US defeating the southern uprising. The Civil War was fought over slavery and those who chose the wrong side of history do not deserve statues. Please do not give them to other cities. Sell them to raise money for the Ali statue. "
40204,"If you want to have these statues and artwork that celebrate this terrible time in our history, put them in a museum where they can be a teachable moment and a cautionary tale. They do not need to be on our streets as a constant reminder to over half of our population that their ancestors were once little more than pigs and cattle and that celebrates a culture that is dead and gone. "
42701,"I appreciate your willingness and desire to receive feedback from community members.  I believe it's time to remove the monuments dedicated to our painful past so we no longer glorify these events.  As a proud Kentuckian and UofL graduate, I love the city of Louisville and hope we can show the rest of the country how to honor our history without displaying pieces symbolizing racism and slavery.  "
40165,Art is art that people create and imagine and dream about and A lot of art is history that everyone is trying to make it go away like it's a bad dream or wrong  in the way of race  
40242,"Mayor,

Please, let's not go down this rabbit hole. These memorials are mostly memorials to the dead of this war, not memorials of racist yesteryear.

 Let's educate our state about the many facets that caused this war, and Kentucky's unique position, somewhere in the middle. Where will this end? Will we remove Henry Watterson's name off of the expressway or elementary school? 

Lastly, just change the Castleman Statue plaque, expound on his service in the Louisville Legion and Park Commissioner Role. There is no need to take that statue down. He was a central figure to that neighborhood and is dressed in civilian garb. 

I think if you dig deep enough into any person's past you will find some sins and something offensive........I am just not sure where this ends. I wish I had more answers, I am in favor of spending money to commission new works that have a Unity Theme.

Ben"
40204,"The Castleman statue should stay.
The effort to rewrite his legacy and posthumously hang him for crimes he did not commit will scar this city."
42303,"You people can review all you want. As soon as the extremists get what they want taken down they will move on to other offending items. This craziness won't stop until the offenders are stopped.
"
40217,"Racism and white supremacy have no place in our community, but the John Breckinridge Castleman monument represents neither. I challenge anyone to show me a statue of a confederate officer who is not in uniform and unarmed. Never mind he retired as a general in the *US* Army. Please note that Castleman, the founder of the American Saddlebred Association, sits atop his favorite mare, Carolina in civilian clothes and unarmed.

Here is a LINK of all the civil war monuments in the state for comparison: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_American_Civil_War_monuments_in_Kentucky

Out of all the monuments there are only two ""confederate officers"" depicted. The John Hunt Morgan memorial went up first in 1911, two years before Castleman, and paid for The Daughters of the Confederacy. Note his confederate uniform and his holstered pistol.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hunt_Morgan_Memorial#/media/File:John_Hunt_Morgan_memorial_-_Lexington,_Kentucky_-_DSC09084.JPG

Now look at Castleman, apparently paid for by family and attired in civilian clothes and unarmed.

Should we tolerate hate? Absolutely not! Should we respect history. Absolutely we should!"
40205,"Take down the Castleman statue. Give it to a museum, let it be a part of history that way.  Public statues are those we look up to (literally and figuratively) not to those who fought against our county and openly pushed for segration"
40207,"Two things: 
1. Please be advised this is in no way a comment in defense of bigotry, racism, and/or slavery. Rather, this submission is an attempt to call attention to the artistry and motivations of the sculptors who created the Castleman statue, the Charlottesville statue, and other monuments all over the country. These sculptors had no political interest in their subject matter; they, like artists everywhere, were (and still are) dependent on commissions to earn a living. They were immigrants and New Yorkers (among others) who created equestrian works of unsurpassed skill. This submission is a plea for the preservation of these works in an appropriate venue where the public can appreciate their historic and artistic significance. One would think that in a city and state where horses are literally iconic it should be possible to relocate the Castleman statue, given its peculiar uniqueness in that the horse actually posed for its sculptor. 

2. My husband, Mr. Michel Samson, is an artist and a native of the Netherlands. He grew up in Holland in a family of artists and can bring a lifetime of expertise to the Louisville review of public art. He has experienced firsthand the horrors of the Nazis as a young child in Northern Europe and he is quite alarmed by the outrageously discriminatory events unfolding here in the US. Michel would very much like to help with the Commission's review in whatever way he can. Please contact him at mesamson@bellsouth.net or by phone at 897-3037.

40216,"I think it's wrong to remove any statues, good or bad. The past is our history, some good some bad. I feel it will not stop at statues. Next will be presidents that owned slaves. Then our money, street names and parks, there's no end to this madness. There's a lot of things that offend me, but I deal with it. Everybody has their feelings hurt at sometime or another. You're just causing more havoc. Put a stop to all this craziness and hatred before it gets more out of control."
40206,"Time to tear down the monuments you speak of.  If they belong anywhere, it's in a museum in which they can be given proper context and pay proper respects to the victims of racism and oppression. "
47130,I don't understand why people can't put themselves in other people's shoes. Public art shouldn't make segments of society feel bad. The South lost. Slavery was bad and the people fighting for it were on the wrong side of history. Replace it with something that looks to a better future. When people lose wars they usually aren't rewarded with statues. It is not erasing history. We all know about Hitler but thank God we don't have to drive around looking at statues of him. 
40215,"If you start removing statutes and art, you need to remove all art and statues. Who has the right to say what is offensive to me and not to someone else, no one "
40245,I believe the confederate statues should be removed from town center areas. I do believe we should always have historical context and art exhibit is one of the best way to showcase this. The idea of relocating or donating them to historical societies or museum seems the best option. It should be narrated in a way that depicts the historical context in its entirety. The figure shouldn't be admired but recognized for The unpatriotic movements made. I feel that uplifting and truly positive historical statues should replace them. Something specific to our communities.
40272,"I would like to see these monuments removed. I fully understand the argument for chronicling history; however, these monuments do not exist as teaching points. These monuments exist to celebrate an ideology, a philosophy steeped in injustice, prejudice, bigotry and a full on assault of not only civil rights but basic human dignity. "
40272,"I think this is a very forward thinking move on the part of our city government.  Within the context of history, an art piece indicative of the time may have its value.  There is value in craftsmanship, technique, finishing, etc.  But even valuable art that is rooted in hatred and bigotry does not need to be displayed as if it were a representation of how our citizens feel today.  If we own this art as citizens of Louisville then we should collectively (democratically) decide its fate.  Maybe to be included in a retrospective of Louisville at a museum at some point in time."
40272," Attempting to erase our country's past will not repair our present or secure our future.  It's the past that reminds us how far we've come.  It shows us how strong the people can be.  If we erase our past, how will future generations know how to not make the same mistakes?  We must be reminded every day to be better. All this political correctness, and getting your feelings hurt, just doesn't make sense to me.  Sometimes you just have to move on. Lack of tolerance for someone else's opinion.  Lack of compassion for each other.  Lack of respect for different races and religions. Lack of accountability for your own actions.  We are just ""lacking"" as a country on every level.  If you want to make America Great Again, start being an example of a great American.  Show tolerance.  Have compassion where it is needed.  Respect other races and religions.  Be accountable for your own actions!  Our country was founded on basic principles. The most important one being, ""All Persons Are Created Equally."" Let's get back to the basics.  You can remove every statue in the state and it will NOT change a thing.  Change must start with each citizen.  "
40245,"the statue in question is not a confederate statue as you know. its honoring a man who obviously contributed alot to louisville outside of his stance in the civil war. many of the buildings and homes, old louisville etc. were built by confederates or confederate sympathizers. do we tear everything down that had some kind of connection to the confederacy? this is crazy, where will it end? i did not agree with the 3rd street statue being removed, but i unstand that one.what makes this generation better than the generation who put it there who may have lost a father, brother, or son fighting for a cause they believed in? if the civil war was only about slavery that would be different, but slavery was a very small part of it till the end of the war. although i think this is a forgone conclusion and your mind is already made up, i say leave it. the statue itself pays no omage to his confederate roots, only a louisvillian who came long before us in a very different time."
40242,"Please keep the statues.  
If there is dissent regarding their meaning or purpose it is more productive to discuss than to just run away.  "
40258,NO DO NOT TAKE MONUMENTS DOWN.....IF YOU TAKE THEM DOWN THEN TAKE DOWN ANY AND ALL THINGS IN REFERENCE TO MUHAMMAD ALI AND MARTIN LUTHER KING
40216,"IT'S HISTORY. Most of these are works have been here for years, moving, taking down is ridiculous. We're people not offended 10 yrs ago, 50 yrs ago. You going to remove Muhammad Ali center or anything to do with Martin Luther King going to rewrite history, NO! and no one I KNOW EXPECTS these things. This has to end somewhere. I'm personally tired of all the reverse discrimination. I and no one in my lifetime or my 85 yr old mothers lifetime owned a slave, non of my or my mothers black friends have ever been slaves. IT'S HISTORY.."
40204,"In the Castleman statue, Castleman is dressed in civies. After the Civil War, Castleman was an officer the US Army. The statute is there because of Casrleman's role in Louisville parks. The statue does not glorify the Confederacy, slavery, repression of anyone, white privilege, or the alt right. The statue is the symbol of the Cherokee Triangle, a progressive neighborhood. Please recommmend to Mayor Fischer that the statue remain in place. It's alright if the Commission wants to recommend the alteration of the historical markers at the intersection of Cherokee Road and Cherokee Parkway to explain the history of slavery on North America, the Civil War, civil rights legislation, and the continuing Civil Rights Movement."
40065,"The monuments should be displayed where people can enjoy them as apart of history not racist, that's how I view them so I think they should stay,but if there gonna move them then move them and all the statues to an open place where they can stand together, United and can be viewed together to show unity and maybe just maybe it'll represent a society coming together with equality and love for one another "
40217,"I believe we should relocate confederate sculptures to a museum, and replace them with new art that celebrates who we are as a city today, not who we once, mistakenly, were.

This will also serve as a show of empathy for, and solidarity with, groups whose ancestors were marginalized by the people these confederate monuments celebrated."
40272,"Leave the statues alone.... They are not ""honoring"" anything. If anything, spend the money on the review for proper history books in jcps schools! The confederates were not the only ""bad guys"" there were plenty from the union who were just as bad or even worse with their actions and owning of slaves. "
40291,I think that this is the time to support people of color in any way that we possibly can. I think the statues related to the celebration of confederate leaders have no place in our city.  We need to take significant action to help promote healing in our community and this is a great first step. 
,"I think when you begin to consider removing public art that can be interpreted to be honoring bigotry, racism, and or slavery you are traversing a slippery slope.  You must consider ALL public art and ALL races and heritages and all history. For example, the statue of Jefferson Davis by City Hall should be removed if you are considering pieces that honor slavery-he owned over 700 slaves and used children of slaves as slave labor in his businesses.  "
40203,I cannot believe our society has actually come to this! First it was removal of Ten Commandments from Courthouse laws because it offended somebody and they wanted to separation of church and state. Now all controversy over statues of symbols in the past. No white person living today ever owned a slave and no black person living today was ever a Slave. People want to move on in the present but how can that be done when everyone wants to live in the past! Next thing you know it will be removal of the American flag because it offends somebody let's get real about this people! Something somewhere is always going to offend somebody!!! If you want to get right down to it how about the Native American Indian after all if you look back on it they were the most pressed first Americans ever. You don't hear them having protests or counter-protest or riots or any of that yet they are stuck on a small piece of land where they are saying here you can live here and you have your own law Force you have your own economics and you have your own government when it was all Theirs to begin with if you want to get right down to the point
47130,"All kinds of art has a place for display.  Some of it speaks to a time when things happened that most modern people are ashamed of and sorry for.  There is a place for those pieces and it's in venues that speak to history, like museums.  It should not be displayed where it could possibly be assumed that the government (who represents everybody!) is in favor of what the art represents.  Not in front of government buildings, public libraries, universities, public parks, etc.  History does not need to be hidden or re-written but as humans evolve away from our violent past, public art must constantly be reviewed to see if it would be offensive.  Thank you.  "
40272,Thought Hitler was killed in the 1940's!!!!! What gives you the right to decide what art is?!!!!
40222,"I do not want our monuments removed, not because I am in favor of slavery, not because I am white, not because I am a bigot, but because it is a part of our collective history!   We are what we are because of our history, good, and bad.  It is art,  it our story,  it is part of Louisville. Don't  take them down, please!!!"
40218,"Remove every single Confederate statue -- or any statue that represents unpatriotic morals -- and put them in a museum.  We don't care if they're destroyed;  they were allegedly erected to demonstrate our history, but the American people have proved too irresponsible and too hateful to learn from the past and instead choose to emulate it.  Our marginalized citizens deserve to live in cities that respect them, and beside neighbors who respect them, rather than in a community that glorifies those who would have happily murdered them or who still desire to do so.  So, no, don't destroy them, but put them in a museum, in CONTEXT, beside the historical information that denounces racism rather than upholds it.  "
40212,"My comment is , are you also going to stop history in schools ,are you going to change the names on our streets , well you might has well burn the flag to ,do away with Martin Luther just as well as George Washington on the old mighty bill ,sorry to say ,you let news media start a war that is never ending ,until the end of all life , instead of stopping history DO AWAY WITH NEWS Media,"
40205,"While I find everything about the events in Charlottesville abhorrent, I wonder if we should take stock of facts and feelings before taking dramatic action that revises the landmarks and the history of our city.  I would instead take concrete action about how permits are granted for protests so that violence and intimidation are not permissible.  First action would be to ban any and all weapons in granting permits to assemble for demonstrations.  The police would then not have to worry about armed groups intimidating them into inaction. "
,History cannot be changed. These are simply beautiful works of art.  LEAVE THEM ALONE
40219,"Remove and replace. If it is private let it stay. If it is tax payer do what the tax payer wants

I am a tax payer and i say replace with something better to show our history and remeber the trials we came from and the progress we had made.... i say had because the racial profiling is absurd.

We can do something meaningful with these statues where they are not displayed in a manner that make certain citizens uncomfortable and add to the negative narritive of our sad history

We need to be reminded of history lest we repeat it but there has to be a way we can all meet in the middle.




"
40076,"No matter how hard you try, you cannot change history. To try to do so would be exactly what the communists and fascists always did. That is part of the history of the United States. Someone will always be offended. If you're going to take down art, which is a fundamental part of this country, then you have to take down all the pictures of Muhhamed Ali. Someone might be offended. They should take down all the statues/portraits of Secretariat, since someone might be offended about horse racing, something that it vital in Kentucky. Don't you see how ridiculous that is? History is not convenient. It's not always good or happy, but you can't pretend that it didn't happen. Those statues don't say that slavery was good. They serve as a reminder of what happened. If you don't know your history, you're going to make the same mistakes. You can't silence art. To try to do so is communism. If someone doesn't agree with you, silence them. If someone says something against your plans, silence them. That's not how this country works. History is history. Moving them to some park or some storage building won't make history any brighter than it was. You know some people don't even believe that the holocaust happened? That's what happens when people don't know their history. "
40291,"I am a retired US Army Veteran of 2 wars. While I am against the removal of the Castleman Statue (for which I will save comments for the public discussion) as I would be for ANY US Veteran memorial, I feel the need to point out all other Louisville Public Arts which too bear examples of links to bigotry, slavery, and discrimination.

For your perusal:

Daniel Boone statue (KY Slave Owner)

Anything Muhammed Ali related: outspoken anti-gay, anti-semitic, anti-interacial couples sentiments in his prime.

George D. Prentice Statue: Venomously Anti Immigrant. His Rhetoric led to the Bloody Monday Massacre.

WWII Memorial: (Japanese Internment Camps)

George Rogers Clark Statue: (Founder of Louisville, Known Slave Owner)

Lincoln Statue: (Freed the slaves, believed blacks and whites were not equals)

Castleman statue: (US Army General, Slave Owner, Served in the CSA)

My point is this, an argument based upon bigotry could be made against any of the above individuals, but we as humans must examine the whole of one's life. We must weigh the bad with the good. Yes, Castleman fought for the CSA. He was pardoned and swore allegiance to the United States as well as affirmed to support the anti-slavery legislation passed during the Civil War. Like the majority of white Americans at the time, Castleman supported segregation. He also did much for the city and he fought with distinction with the US Army in defense of Democracy. "
40118,"The people who are protesting these statues & art work have never been slaves & are just using this as an excuse to destroy this country & it's  historical reminders.  They act out like a lynch mob demanding attention from the media.  
If the law was enforced & these people punished for their destruction then maybe these people would stop.  By giving in to their ridiculous demands to erase all white history is giving into their demands. ( the reason I say white history is because they aren't destroying anything to do with black statues ) When will it stop?  Louisville was a big place to sell slaves in the long ago past?  If they should decide to burn louisville down to try to erase that part of history- are you going to stand back & watch that also?  
These people are just a bunch of attention seekers wanting to get their pix in the media.  
If they want something changed why don't they go about it the correct way?  A mob seeking violence is not the way.  
Why don't people realize that the art work showing how slavery was (way before our time)  makes us see how bad it was & we should never want to have that happen again.  Those are our reminders. 
These protesters are huge crowds & want to tear up for attention.  Treat them like any other criminal.  Urge them to turn their attention & time against drugs & drug dealers.  ( although a lot of the protesters are on drugs).  Have they focus on changing things that are hurting our country now, not things that are done & gone.  "
40216,"No government dictator, mayor, governor, President, or anybody should have the ability to decide for anyone else what’s racist or bigoted. Just as beauty is in the eye of the beholder same applies to what is considered racist or bigoted. "
40059,"I suggest removing the plaques from the confederate statues and instituting a cooling off period to carefully consider all sides. Removing them now is likely to incite more anger and more violence.

These statues are works of art as well as a reminder of our past - good & bad - and help to tell the story of who we are, and how we got to where we are today. Ray Bradbury's ""Fahrenheit 451"" comes to mind. ISIS has destroyed monuments to the past because they didn't like what they stood for, and now they are lost to future generations. Are we really going to start down that same path? I hope not. We can't change our history, but we can learn from it, and perhaps not make the same mistakes again.

A personal example - when I was a little girl, we had relatives in Bardstown...one who worked at the Nelson County courthouse. My mother pointed out the block of concrete in front of the courthouse where slaves had been sold. When she told me the story, I was horrified, even as a 6-yr old, that men, women and children had been forced to stand on that block and have people buy them. It was a visceral reaction. I don't know if the block is still there or if it has been removed...but, it was a reminder and perhaps because I saw it and learned about it as a small child that is part of the reason I still have a visceral reaction to oppression of any kind. Without reminders of our history, we cheat future generations from learning about it."
47118,"First, I know I am a Hoosier now, but grew up in Kentucky, the daughter of Lewis B. Kerberg, General Manager of The Louisville Area Chamber of Commerce so hopefully that qualifies me to have some input. I am in no way fond of the monuments to people who fought in favor of slavery and wish that, like Germany which has no statues of Nazi generals, we had never put them up. But they're here. Why not leave them but put plaques at their bases that give a lengthy and accurate accounting of who these people really were, what they really stood for, and what they really did. No more history as written by the winners but an honest accounting and food for thought and maybe change. Begin with the fact that there were two major building frenzies of these monuments (turn of twentieth century and mid fifties-sixties)and each time they were in response to minorities gaining more equal treatment under the law as opposing forces pushed back. They haven't been there since the Civil War. "
40206,"As a citizen who wants to see Louisville become more unified and open, I would sincerely like to see all statues that have to do with Confederate leaders removed. Germany does not have statues celebrating / honoring Hitler. While Nazi Germany was a key part of their history, they do not celebrate it, as it slaughtered and dehumanized millions of its people and neighbors. Let's not do the same here. Thank you! "
40205,Confederate statues were placed around the south in order to rehabilitate and support the ideology of white supremacy. Tear them all down and commission new works of art to replace them. 
40207,"This is the beginning of censorship.  We should not be removing art and historical representations around the city because they offend a select few.  There are art pieces, ideas, and laws that offend all of us. It is part of belonging to a democracy.  Removing and thus forgetting history will make us destined to repeat it."
40241,"You cannot change or erase history, removing the statues would be a slap in the face to American history. Instead we should focus our attention on loving our neighbors while using the art to teach and hopefully avoid history repeating itself. In short STOP TRYING TO ERASE HISTORY!!"
47150,"Even though i live in New Albany Ind. I do use the Louisville area for viewing Art. This idea of the government ""filtering"" Art for my viewing is wrong! The only interpretations that should be  welcomed are in the eyes of the beholder! Everyone is entitled to their opinions,, so be it !! Thank you for listening to mine."
40291,"Any piece of ""ART"" can and is interpreted by the viewer ! Their interests sway their logic to satisfy a preconceived venue. No one can claim another's opinion should not be allowed, our opinions are a part of the promised freedom. As an example my opinion of a confederate flag is that it is the symbol of USA's very first CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENTS - not a sign of protecting the slave industry - old glory prevailed and the USA got better. Slave owners changed (some black & some white owners) and we have continued to improve. 
Even this great society can be conquered  when it is split into - then its enemy can fight with both sides killing many until the enemy wins. Our solidarity is being desroyed for no good purpose. We need to be Americans. PERIOD! Not any desctiption other than PATRIOTIC -- not white, not latino, not arab , not irsh, not German, not African, etc........... "
40241,"You cannot erase history, you should use the monuments as moment to teach people so that they can learn to not do the same that was done years ago. "
40216,"Who will be in charge of deciding what is ""Offensive"" to whom?  Keep in mind that are tons of books in the Louisville Free Public Library that will have to be burned under the criteria you will most likely have to choose.  You are opening a keg of worms that you will not be able to close.  Where have all these ""protesters"" been in the past 100 or so years..   Amazing what a ""bandwagon"" can accomplish and the end results most likely will be much worse than you might believe...   Good luck... you are going to need it...."
40223,"After reading the narrative that accompanied this survey, I realized ,you mayor,are just looking for a way to justify removing these monuments. It will only further divide this community. Trump is the President because the liberal agenda was inflicted on all Americans without any listening.. These monuments, a part of our history have never been viewed as an issue before. They are only one now as the left searches for something to punish Trump and the people who voted for him."
42261,"Keep the statues because it is part of our history.
People learn from the past, good or bad. We have tried to learn from the past so we don't repeat the bad parts of our history."
,Art is subjective.  Its for people to look at and admire or look at and criticize.  You cannot remove art because it offends..  art is supposed to bring out emotions.  If you censor art where does it stop... it doesnt.  Next will be books and music and eventually you'll ship people who offend you away... sound familiar.  Yeah the Nazis did the same thing.  You Mayor Fischer are no better than the hate groups.
40272,"I can not stand racist. We need to make sure Charlottesville never happens again. But we cant lert people sit in judgement of others from our countrys past. This is like Comunisim next we will be burning books. History is not being taught in school, Kids have to kow the mistakes of our past so they dont repeat them in the future. Lets also not forget that at least half of this country had family members that fought on the Confederate side, so dont throw rocks out of a glass house. Also let us not forget that the Democratic party were the ones that fought to keep slavery and that same party are the ones wanting to remove art and statues... By the way Castleman was exiled from America and live in france for 10 years. He came back and did a lot of good for this city. Creating park systems of many parks that still are here today including where his statue is. George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and several others owned slaves should we remove their statues. Even when Lincoln was in the White House slaves were the servants so should we get rid of his statues. If you want to move them to a museum thats fine. But dont destroy them over your guilty concious and trying to get Votes. I hope reason takes over and you realize how important these statues are to our history. You cant just erase history its still our history good bad and ugly as Americans and our Kids need to know about it.

"
40216,"Some points:

- the continued removal of public art is unnecessary, and distracting relative to more serious problems in our community that remain to be effectively addressed by the current administration.  

- should we continue, however, we should designate a museum to provide in-depth education on the civil war and history of enslavement in our country.  The removed artifacts - however I'll-advised that activity is - can be displayed there.

- censorship of any kind is a slippery slope and antithetical to free expression and thought.   We cannot hide the dark underbelly of our past, simply because we don't like it or it makes us uncomfortable.  We must learn to face it together and, in unity, resolve to prevent any recurrences."
40206,"It's time to end the glorification of the confederacy. Removal isn't erasing or subverting history, it's an honest admission that we have glorified these villains for far too long. 

We must now face that these statues were placed by men and women as a protest against civil rights and as an attempt to enshrine a false history about the reasons for the civil war. "
40206,"Absolutely ridiculous! These are historical statues.  The meaning I see is one of hope.  That this is a country forever striving for what is right.  These statues represent a strong people who rose up above one of the most evil things that America allowed at the time.  I want those statues there for generations of children to ask their parents what it was about.   I hate that my kids were too young to ever know Jews that were in concentration camps by their tattooed numbers.  By not being able to see these things, the impact of true evil is never really seen or felt"
40272,"I think the commemorative statues (art, as you call it) should be left as they are and as they have been for many years.  They are not hurting anyone.  If anyone is offended by them, they need to go to school and take some history lessons.  They are a piece of history and moving them or destroying them will not change the history that they represent.  They stand for multiple things.  If they must be removed from their current position, why not use vacant land that the city owns or purchase some land and make a history park for the monuments along with plaques or signage that would give insight as to what the true history of them are.  It is ridiculous that we have already lost one of them and it is terrible to think that we should lose any more.  Offer free history lessons instead.  Stop catering to one group or the other especially when it comes to out history and our heritage.  Some of us had family that fought in previous wars.  Some of us have Native American blood and I have research and I know what happened to many, many Native Americans along with their families and their land.  History hurts sometimes but it is there and removing a statue or monument is not going to take that away.  I also think that removing these will start another war whether it be in our city alone or another Civil war within our United States.  Please leave things as they are.  
"
42748,Leave the monuments alone. How is taking them down going to change anything?
40299,"Leave the Confederate statues alone. It's crazy to try to sanitize history and say it didn't happen. This is a Nazi technique at it's finest. We didn't live during the Civil War and no one today should sweep it under the rug. We need to remember what happened so the mistakes of our ancestors aren't repeated. The more knowledge we have, the richer we are. 

My Confederate ancestors were mostly poor dirt farmers from families divided by the conflict. Most just needed a pay check, signed up, and left to do a job. Many never returned and many fought their own brothers on tbe battlefields of Hell. Let them rest in peace.

Ignorance is dangerous.

40229,Keep the statues. They are important for our history. 
40205,"I support removing statues that honor the confederacy. As a society we need to show that we condemn racism and bigotry. Leaving these statues up communicates that we feel, at best, ambivalent about racism. Taking them down communicates that we value the humanity and dignity of people of color. "
40223,"I believe that any form of art glorifying the confederation  needs to come down. This is by no means cleansing history. We have thousands of books on this subject. 
Take. Them. Down.    Please "
40204,"I do not believe that the confederates should be honored by memorial statues. The history should definitely be taught properly but absolutely not honored through memorials. 
The confederates did not even want to be a part of the United States. They waged war against this country and they fought to protect their right to own other humans. Why would we want to honor them?"
40217,"It cannot be said often enough that statues of Confederate leaders and soldiers are symbols of an era that assumed black people were lesser beings, not worthy of equal standing under democratic system. When you consider when most of these monuments were erected, it becomes clear that it was their attempt at revisionist history, remaking the leaders who had been declared traitors as honorable men. It was also making clear to blacks that they were STILL considered lesser beings. 

I cannot imagine the conversation black parents have to have  explaining why these statues still hold places of civic honor in our city and state. As long as they remain, it is a public reminder that Jim Crow is still coursing as a poisonous stream under the surface of our public discourse, that persons who declare the equality of all while defending the Confederate statues, are hiding the guilty secret that believe the ""southern myth"" and are at best believers in their right to hold onto their white privilege; and at worst are closet racists.

The statues must go."
40220,It us ridiculous that my city is even contemplating removing the statue at Cherokee Triangle.  That statue represents far more than the Confederate Army or its principles. We should not remove that nor any other statue that represents our history.  
40206,"I am a transplant to Louisville from an area of central Minnesota so homogeneously white in the 1980s that racism seemed to a white child growing up there something very bad but also entirely theoretical. While of course I now have a much broader view of our country, it still boggles my mind each time I discover the symbolic respect accorded in the public sphere to Confederate ""heroes"" in the South. I fully agree that we should not ""whitewash"" history: these figures (at least the important ones), their stories and their failures should be taught in schools and museums, explored in books and television. It is important to remember that they existed. But giving them pride of place on public property, showing them looking heroic or serious or purposeful, without commentary or condemnation, cannot fail to send a message that these are figures to be admired and celebrated. And that message cannot fail to be confusing, painful and even degrading to the morals of many Louisvillians and visitors, including my young son who is growing up in this diverse, vibrant, compassionate city. They are confusing and painful for me--so much so that I consistently avoid looking at them. I favor removing these monuments to a more appropriate educational venue. If they are to remain, I favor altering the presentations, somehow, to make it immediately clear to the viewer that the city does not celebrate them or recommend them for admiration."
40218," We should remove all confederate statues. As you don't see statues erected of other generals and such that we fought against.  You might as well erect one to Hitler, Tojo, or Mussolini  if that is the case "
40207,"It is past time for our city to remove public art that celebrates and reminds people of racism, discrimination and colonization."
40217,"Take them down.  Put a plaque up noting that they were once there and now a progressive, compassionate city has opted to replace them.  With a tree, perhaps!  Lord knows we need more trees.


And here is a great example for Louisville:

"
40216,"While I know that these statues were erected to honor Confederates from KY many years ago, I do not believe that we should be honoring the reason the war we fought.  If we want to honor Kentuckians I believe we can find those who do not represent slavery, hate and racism."
40245,"I appreciate your opening this up to public comment.  I can't even imagine what kind of racist, misspelled garbage you'll have to wade through.  Hats off to you!!  

In my opinion, people are multi-faceted.  Noone is just all good or all evil.  Thomas Jefferson owned slaves and Mussolini made the trains run on time.  (Well, actually no, but whole other story.  #fakenews)  There's nothing wrong with saluting someone for their good accomplishments even if they were a flawed person.  Nothing wrong with calling out a person's bad acts even if they were an overwhelmingly good person.  You can't let popularity or politics get too close to art.  

So how do you spend the city's money on the right things that make people happy but ultimately keep opinions and art separate?  My humble submission for a list of criteria:

1-- Is the work promoting a viewpoint or is it simply depicting a historical figure or event?  In this sense, I think a painting of a former mayor hanging at city hall is probably a historical commemoration of the person's service.  ""This person was our mayor"" is all it says.  A statue, painting or naming of a building or highway may be seen to advocate a general honor or agreement that a person bears historical significance, rather than any commentary about the person's personal life or views.  

2-- If the person is being recognized for an accomplishment, was that accomplishment (for lack of a better word) ""good""?  We have the Gene Snyder freeway because that's the person who got us the highway.  Pretty straightforward, but still commemorates an accomplishment we in modern days view as a good thing. If it turned out that highway was full of arsenic and hundreds of babies died as a result, and Gene Snyder laundered millions of dollars that he then spent on heroin, it's probably not an achievement that should be commemorated any longer. 

3-- If the accomplishment was good, was it so significant that it outweighs any moral failings of its subject?  OR If the art commemorates an entire person, was the person on the whole considered well in the light of history?  Martin Luther King Dr. is obviously in honor of a person's huge accomplishments.  A pretty flawed human being in other respects, MLK was still so significantly influential that a statue just celebrating HIM, not even any particular accomplishment, is worthy of a spot on the national mall.  Joe Paterno, on the other hand, had a statue celebrating his accomplishments taken down, because it seemed too much like it celebrated HIM as a person.  

4-- Can the work of art be commissioned to make clear the distinction between person and accomplishment, and between modern and historical mores?  OR If an existing work of art, can its frame of reference as a depiction of formerly held sentiments be made clear enough to outweigh its unsuitability by modern standards, or does it hold such historical or artistic significance as to justify its subject matter? Wernher von Braun got us to the moon, but the guy also happened to be a Nazi.  So you don't see a lot of science labs named after him.  If a city wanted to honor his accomplishments, it could create a mural of the moon landing, or a statue of him in his lab.  The accompanying placard could acknowledge that he had a controversial background but also many great accomplishments.  (But to criterion #3, if Josef Mengele had gone on to cure cancer, you probably still wouldn't commission his portrait to hang in your hospital.)  Nobody will be burning Guernica for its strong political sentiment, even if you disagree.  And you'd be hard pressed to tear down Monticello for its being a former slave plantation.

In regard to the Castleman statue currently at issue:
1-- The statue does not promote a viewpoint-- while the equestrian statue may connote a military honor, Castleman is shown in civilian clothing.  The accompanying placards, however, praise his military career as a confederate soldier.  
2-- Hard to discern any specific accomplishment; many are listed but the statue may only hint at his work with saddlebred horses.  By this standard, the statue appears to honor the whole person or a fairly minor accomplishment among more substantial weight given to the confederate accomplishments.
3-- The statue as a whole, and its accompanying descriptions, do seem to convey honor on the whole person, not any (certainly well-known) accomplishment.  As such, it does not seem that this was a well-regarded person on balance, but not overwhelmingly so.
4-- The art already exists, and is probably not of significant historical or artistic significance (though it is registered as a historic monument, so one point for that side.)  As it stands currently, it is certainly not made clear that it does not intend to glorify the confederacy, slavery, etc.

I don't know the particulars of Mr. Castleman's history with the city, his views on race, or really much about him except the existence of the statue of a guy on a horse who looks like Col. Sanders somewhere on the east side.  Yes, he's in civilian clothes, but I just assumed a statue of a guy on a horse was meant to depict a military honor, and the plaques surrounding the statue sure make it clear that this was the intent. By that standard, I believe the city should not support any glorification of the confederacy.  A statue signifies honor when it's out in public-- historical art when it's in a statue garden or art museum.  ""This guy did some great stuff"", says a statue.  Whatever that guy is shown doing in the statue, or what we list as his accomplishments on the accompanying descriptions, is what we think is great.  Waging war against the US in order to keep people in chains is not great.  No modern local or state government should ever come close to making it seem like they think it is.  That said, the placards would be an easy fix to convey this message and leave the historic nature of the statue.  ""This statue was put here by people who really loved this guy and his ""patriotic"" work in the confederacy.  He was wrong in hindsight to have done that, and they probably had the wrong reasons, at least in part, for creating this statue to honor him.  But it's historically relevant that these kind of statues used to exist, and that lots of people even today still want them to.  This new plaque was put here by people who don't like slavery but are just glad he helped with our parks or whatever.""  It's not censorship to take down your own statue when you don't like it anymore, but it does give you a lot more power sometimes to take an opportunity to explain a historical injustice instead of just paving over it.  

You might also want to add, ""Despite the strong resemblance, he is not related to Col. Sanders."""
," I believe that the statues of Confederate soldiers should be removed from their prominent positions in Louisville.  Given recent events, these statues have become symbols of institutional acceptance of bigotry and white nationalism, neither of which represent the city that I know and love.  Even without the context of recent events, these statues serve a primary purpose of commemorating the Confederacy. Personally I feel that we owe no honor to those who killed American soldiers to try and preserve their perceived right to subjugate fellow human beings.  

I do agree that the preservation of history is important, but there are more appropriate places to keep these statues, such as historical sites and museums, where proper historical context can be given.  With these options, historical preservation is no excuse for keeping these statues in their current position.  Removing or relocating these statues is an important gesture that we must undergo to clearly state that we as a city choose compassion and inclusion over division and hate. "
40205,Leave monuments alone    It's public art   part of our country' and city's young history People are being incited to react from persons trained to do so. They are vandalizing landmarks  You don't see public art/building banners outside the Watterson  That's what makes a city vs suburb unique. That's why we live here for the history  Does this mean we now get to vote on any public display?  Good luck with that cause there won't be any then  it has gone too far   No installation is going to be 100 % backed.  I don't particularly like honoring some of the local history/events/art that we as a city do. But I deal with it  because it means a lot to someone else and that is what makes Louisville great
40212,"Leave them alone , the statues have  been there this long they are a part of our history.  Stop trying to sanitize history . This is 1984 coming true . "
,"There is no positive value in relics of the Jim Crow era that were (arguably, I suppose) intentionally put up as symbols of opposition to civil rights. Remember the ugly parts of history, study them, learn from them. But the statues in our city ought to be something that everyone can be proud of, or at least that doesn't remind half the population that there are still people who consider them less than human."
40205,"We should not enshrine bigots. I am relieved that the Confederate monument no longer stains the campus of the University of Louisville, and I would be even more relieved if the remaining monuments to Confederates are removed. "
40229,"No censorship!!!  Art is subjective by nature and interpretation is up to the viewer, not government."
40207,"The removal of statues and monuments that pay tribute to traitors - and that's what Confederates were - is not changing, hiding or 'sanitizing' history. No one advocates altering history textbooks, historical films or other learning media. It's quite easy for me to understand African Americans' pain and resentment at seeing tributes to those who committed treason in the name of keeping them in bondage. That hurt is enough in itself for me to advocate the removal of Confederate shrines and memorials.

Washington, Jefferson, and others - though slaveholders - are (and should continue to be) honored  for their huge contributions to the country, not for treasonous activity or fighting to keep slavery legal. That people don't grasp the difference between the likes of an imperfect Washington or Jefferson, versus Lee or Davis, is hard for me to understand."
40229,We should leave our art where it is .  If we start removing then you will start people feeling that a lot of things will have to be removed .People are all over with comments wanting things removed if we start removing you will never please some . We will have to be able to vote on this with  the election for it to be done fair not with comments .Thank you 
40214,"Leave everything alone, Louisville has so many historic markers, statues, and memorials, you cannot let a small minority pick and choose which ones stay or which ones go. If you do, who's to say that the War Memorial on River Road or Farnsley Moorman house be removed. Leave all of them alone, you cannot or will not make everyone happy. Our leaders have cowled down to people that find anything remotely offensive. Remember when parents taught tough love, thats what a lot of our citizens need.
"
40214," I think the statues should remain. Some of them have been around 100 years or so and not until recently has anyone labeled them offensive. The staues resemble people and a time in history! People of the modern day era make the stories of the statues and their resemblance sound offensive and hurting. If history was not meant to be remembered don't you think GOD would have changed all of that long ago? The statues aren't hurtful and offensive,  mean PEOPLE ARE!."
40219,"well since you want to remove things that may offend people this is what offends me. the way you kiss b;lacks asses! so if you are going to be fair which i doubt you are! remove anything and everything about matin luther king, muhammad ali museum should be closed, all the names of our streets with blacks need to be changed! i've had enough of the blacks getting their way about every little thing so you start removing stuff that offend whites too. because it's quite obvious you bow down to blacks constantly. how about your own damn race for a change? and byu the well your next election i will make sure i do NOT vote for you and i hope most all whites don't either. you like kissing black people's asses way to much to suit me!"
40222,Remove the civil war monuments. It's time to move on and not celebrate hate. 
40215,"I personally do not believe tearing down any monument is the solution to this problem. Tearing down a monument and renaming a park in Charlottesville is what caused this mess. I feel like if you let this happen, there may be repercussions. They have already started their attacks. They spray painted the Lincoln Monument. So what happens next? The Japanese that now reside in the U.S. get offended by a WWII monument and cause a big uproar and then we have to remove all WWII monuments? These civil war monuments are part of US History. A war that was fought by US citizens. They were placed so that future generations would remember and LEARN from them. I fear that if you do this, you're only going to make matters worse. Also...as stated before...I am afraid that since we are a country of many nationalities, ANY WAR MONUMENT honoring US citizens that has fought in ANY WAR will be made to come down. I would rather see my tax money spent on efforts to crack down on these hate groups, of any race. then to see these, and possibly in the future, ANY monument honoring US citizens who fought in ANY war come down."
40242,"Based upon the criteria of Confederate related statues in Louisville being classified as art we have a public duty not to remove or change the intent of those who designed them. The artists hired to design and execute the statues have a right/expectation that their legacy not be removed from public view. We've already moved one Confederate monument over perceived public outrage despite the fact another monument was placed nearby to put everything into historical context. Does that monument come down as its apparent function is no longer valid?  Most of these Confederate statues were designed and placed in situ during an era when the combatants of both sides had come to terms with ""their"" conflict. We must be cautious not to put our current beliefs (in this case 21st Century) on art, writing, and symbols of the 19th and early 20th Centuries. While there are documents as to the when/where of the placing of the monuments we are unable to speak to those who actually participated in their creation to understand the motives of the time. Where will it end? Will the commission remove any art based upon public outrage or because any one group is offended? I suggest our challenge is to leave the art in their current places so we may rationally discuss the history of the past. A simple marker with a few facts about the Civil War is a much more suitable and cost effective way to get the message across. However, when we assume that we are wiser than those who proceeded us by hiding our past we run the risk of recreating the very conflict they resolved. Does the commission wish to take on the role of the Nazi's and decide what is acceptable and/or approved by the state in regard to art?  The United States is built on a premise that we are continually evolving and that we learn from our past. In closing I end with the fond memory of my great-grandmother regaling me as a child with stories of her youth; of Union and Confederate veterans telling each other ""War Stories"" as she attended various GAR functions or sat on the steps of the Confederate Veterans home in PeWee Valley. She spoke of the admiration both sides had for each other and that they had ""buried the hatchet"" and ""soon only the monuments will remain to tell their tale."" Is this to be a one-sided story?     "
,"Please no public art that glorifies hate, or outdated ideas that could be offensive. Stick with local sculptors with visions of inclusive love for all. "
40223,Please don't take away our history by removing statutes or any art form. We have to remember our history no matter what it was. Avoid censorship. The tragedy in Charlottesville of the protestors death is terrible but we must be open to dialogue and free speech from all sides. It seems that free speech is eroding in our country.  Thank you for allowing me to comment. 
40219,You can't change history by removing it. Leave the art where it's at. If you must do something give factual information of what roll that person played in History. You could also erect statues of individuals who played a part in liberating people as a counter part.  
40207,I was a resident of the Cherokee Triangle for 32 years I walked & drove past the Castleman Statue every day and enjoyed the  art. I did not know the history of the man who was riding the horse or why he was placed in that spot. I am disgusted to discover that this man on the horse was a segregationist and traitor to our country and that the statue was funded by people who supported his actions. Take it down. Put a fountain in its place.
40204,"Please don't spend tax payer dollars to remove historic statues unless they are tied directly to an obvious racist. For example, if the statue was erected because that person was most known for his mistreatment of human beings not that he helped build the foundation of Louisville and he happened to own slaves.  Owning slaves was common in the South at that time.  
Let's please focus on current issues in the city such as our homeless population, opioid epidemic, gang and drug violence, murders , etc.
Thank you, 
Karen"
40059,"Look to countries and cities that have had to deal with public displays that reflect on times of historic atrocities.  Berlin is an excellent example of a city which doesn't shy away from its story, but tells each important aspect with critical context.  Also critical to each piece is when they were created? Where the statues are is important. Should we erase history? No, but it is hard to convince myself we haven't already, where can I find art or information about the segregation of our city? Or about the slave owners and slaves? if we all plan to move forward, the stories of these awful people/times need to be available and told clearly, but they also need to be told in a specific context sensitive manner. I am all for moving these statues and organizing a local group who can work to tell their story, similarly we should be telling the stories of the people they impacted. In Berlin monuments to hitler don't exist, some soviet monuments do, but these stories are balanced with Jewish memorials, and the holocaust meuseum and give a context to the entire period. How does our city tell the story of slavery and emancipation or segregation and pervasive racial prejudice. I would suggest that we have avoided telling that story at all costs and now more than ever it is important to bring those stories to light to face the ills of our community if we ever expect to have productive conversation and move forward together.

If any history has been erased it is the injustice faced by minorities and African Americans in our community. reorienting/moving/destroying these other works is a first step in helping start to tell these stories in with the levity and accuracy they deserve.

"
40229,"""One persons junk is another persons treasure."" It's art that was put up without issue. Why suddenly review it and remove it now? Tired of the majority giving into pressure of a few. When its said ""It's cheaper to do want the few want to avoid court cost."" Fight back for what wr believe in PLEASE. That includes all signs of our history as well. I have said before, if you remove just a few pieces of art and 1 piece of our history you must remove it all. Are you going to remove anything of say Martin Luther King if people say it offends them? I'm sure you won't and it shouldn't be. Leave things alone and stop caving in to the few. "
47167,Leave the art alone you can't change history. What's next are you going to quit teaching history in the schools.
40222,"I heard a quote from Bevin on the radio today. He stated that the removal of confederate monuments would be a sanitizing history, or something to that effect. If we want to commemorate anything, I'd think it would be the individuals who worked to end slavery. So how about this: let's replace the current confederate monuments with statues of civil rights leaders? Or just take them down. That way, the not-so-subtle message of hostility and exclusion exuding from confederate monuments can be translated into something positive for the community. 

The nation is ripping apart. Extend an olive branch. "
47150,"I think it is important to remember the past, but look forward to the future. I also few issues are as right or wrong as people like to think. 
I suggest putting a plaque alongside confederate art saying something along the lines of ""This is a reminder of a dark time in our history. It serves as a reminder to future generations of the events that took place to lead to where we are now and the mistakes that were made, so we do not repeat them. We refuse to go back to a time when hate tore this country in two."""
40207,"I was saddened by the signs some of the protesters carried during the protest. Ex.  ""White lives murder"". All people have done horrendous things in the name of their point of viiew. I still however believe some of these folks expressing these views have a right to speak. However, this is now moving pretty close to hate speech. I would like for you to consider this: 

Thomas Jefferson once said that “difference of opinion leads to inquiry and inquiry leads to truth.” Truth is found in the exploration of ideas. When a society’s information is limited, their perception of truth is misguided. "". 

Art is not just paint to a canvas; it plays an important role in human communication and is not only an expression of the artists themselves, but also a reflection of the period in which it was created. Because art is used as a tool for communication and expression, it is often censored or manipulated to coincide with political beliefs. 

Hitler’s Culture Propaganda 
“This cleansing of our culture must be extended to all fields. Theatre, art, literature, cinema, posters, and window displays must be cleansed of all manifestations of our rotting world and placed in the service of a moral, political, and cultural idea.” 

When thinking of the civil war artwork, I would ask that we consider education, discussion and thought. I would ask you how far does this cleansing go? Do we later begin to cleanse ourselves of the all thoughts and people who gave a link to these times? And then, do we even begin to rid our society of anyone related to these people in fear they hold the same views. Hitler's quote should remind us of the slippery slope that can occur when this sort of cleansing occurs. "
40207,The monuments of Confederate War participants need to be removed from public spaces. They memorialize people that fought a war on the side that wanted to continue to enslave people. They were also erected during times when Jim Crow laws were being introduced and the Civil Rights Movement was taking place as a way to continue to threaten black people. To have to drive in your city and see people being honored that wish you didn't exist and have taken violent action try to make that so is inhumane and should no longer happen in our country. Yes we need to teach history but we need to teach all of our history as a country and take responsibility for the fact that the US was built on the back of Native Americans and African Americans both of which were violently forced from their homes. Put the monuments in a museum if you want but do not leave them in public view so as to continue to threaten people. Take them down.
40207,"If Louisville is to be an example of a place where Compassion and loving connection in our world are valued and esteemed, it seems to me that the Confederate Statues are marking a time in history of violence and separateness--of fear of the ""other"".  I support removing Confederate statues in our midst.  I also support removing them in an unceremonious way.  "
40219,"I think that the offensive art pieces should be destroyed, although as they are a part of history (the wrong side) they should be put in a museum or somewhere where it wouldn't be so offensive. "
40299,"Individuals have many opinions about what is art and what is offensive. Removing items from our city's history is a very slippery slope and will divide us in terrible ways.
We are struggling with peace without this being added to the mix. I ask that we do not start the path of revising our city's history. These monuments serve as reminders of our past. Should the Holocaust museum in DC  be closed as it is a symbol of horrible atrocities too.
Thank you for your respectful consideration."
40204,"The confederate statues need to be put in a museum. The people these  statues honor tried to break up this country. They are a part of history and should not be destroyed, just removed."
40272,"History cannot be changed or sanitized. Instead of removing the art, why not add an artful addition that explains that as the country has grown its views have changed and we've grown stronger. ---- United We Stand, Divided We Fall ---- I think a factual art display is much more important than trying to ignore or hide certain periods/events from the past.

Let's keep our existing public art and add to it in order to show our historical past as well as the present."
40216,"Please remove these inaccurate, highly offensive, oppressive, racist staties from our public spaces!"
42101,"Born and raised in Louisville, though I live in Bowling Green at the moment.

Personally, I think it's odd that we have Confederate monuments at all in a state that never belonged to the Confederacy and was nearly destroyed by it. It seems unpatriotic and an insult to the Union soldiers that fought and died protecting our state.

Considering how many Louisvillians are upset by them today for the interpretation of honoring racist ideals, I think it makes the most sense to remove them.

If arguments about retaining history are found to have merit, relocation to a museum instead of outright destruction seems like an adequate compromise."
40205,"I support the REMOVAL of monuments and other items that honor the Confederacy. Such symbols fly in the face of the dignity and humanity of our community members. And, given the recent rise in white supremacist violence, these symbols are clearly not serving as deterrents to repeating shameful parts of our history like their supporters claim."
40242,"Those monuments that commemorate Confederate soldiers and officers need to be removed.  Germany does not have statues of Hitler, the SS, or any of their WWII officers because they understand what a dark place in history those people represent.  The appropriate place for these statues would be in with the Confederate section of Cave Hill cemetery.  We can honor the dead in Cave Hill but we should not have the reminder of the fight for slavery in public space.  That is not the place for them.  For the Castleman Statue, it should be replaced with a statue of Frederick Law Olmsted or some other figure that helped establish Louisville's park system.  It can also be replaced with a statue of Tom Owen.  It can be replaced with a fountain.  Anything but a figure who at one point was exiled from the United States.  In any location where there is a monument to the Confederacy, there are most certainly more appropriate figures, whether prominent local Civil Rights Leaders, respected Louisvillians, or some aspect of the neighborhood that would be a much more significant subject to memorialize."
40205,"Regarding the John Castleman statue, I believe that it represents Louisville's history and is also a beautiful piece of art (among many) that makes this city unique. To me his statue represents his involvement in Louisville's economic and parks development as opposed to what he did for the confederacy. Leaving it up along those lines should be justifiable  -- but even if it partly represents the confederacy I think taking it down white washes history. If anything it helps propel conversation about that time in history and how it was wrong. No one is going to the statute and worshiping it as a symbol of racism. Keep the statue. "
40229,"If we decide to start banning any and every piece of Public Art we can't just look at the obvious things that can be interpreted as honoring bigotry, racism and/or slavery. Every person has different opinions on what is offensive to them so if the decision is made to remove only the items that offend some then in my opinion you must remove ALL Public Art. Take down the monuments to the World Wars, Korean War, remove Muhammad Ali as he is considered offensive for refusing to defend his country. The list will go on and on.  The Public Art you are referring to may have been initially commissioned to honor a past action but intelligent people use it as a reminder of what we don't want to see again. Are we going to quit teaching history in schools because it offends us? No it's a learning tool. All removing the Public Art does is further create a divide within the community.  It creates resentment with those that support the Public Art.  I grew up with segregation started in Jefferson County Schools. My parents wanted me to attend a private school to avoid being exposed to this but I choose to attend Western High School and I'm proud of that. This was the seventies and as history shows it was not a well accepted thing.  However we moved past this.  We can't erase history and it's up to us as parents and grandparents to education the younger generation on respect for everyone for no one had a choice of the race or national origin. Once we learn to respect everyone all this goes away but respect is earned not demanded, again race or national origin does not count. Treat people as you want to be treated.  Such a simple concept but forgot by so many. Please leave the Public Art in place, if you choose to change the standards of what is allowed in the future that is what the commission is for, to second guess the past is the wrong decision."
40204,"A compassionate city could not maintain monuments to racism, slavery, and the Confederacy in places of honor. Move them to where they can serve as prompts to remember and discuss the darker parts of our history, thereby to renew our commitment to make amends. This includes the John B. Castleman statue in the Cherokee Triangle. I live in Tyler Park, and I have close family in the Cherokee Triangle. I pass by this statue almost daily. I understand this monument was ostensibly erected to honor his service to the city of Louisville, but an impartial review of his biography suggests that service has been overstated. There is little to nothing in his life that could overshadow or atone for the fact that he fought and killed for the cause of slavery. Indeed, two facts seem to suggest a continuation - rather than a reversal and correction - of his racist, white supremacist values and principles: The fact that his autobiography celebrates his service to the Confederacy, and his efforts in later years to segregate Louisville's parks. In short, he is not the sort of man I want representing me and my neighborhood. I would like to see this statue replaced with one of Andrew Cowan, or another monument that we could all be proud of.

Thank you for your consideration and your service.

Sincerely,
Nick Braden"
40207,"This is the story of a young hothead who joins an admittedly racist group, does very serious damage, is caught and faces death. Through the intervention of a highly placed individual, who lays the law down to him, saying basically, boy you are in serious trouble, you have to leave the country and you can never come back unless you admit your wrongs, and straighten up and fly right. He realizes he was wrong, swears allegiance to the U.S., returns, turns his life around, and spends the rest of his life doing good, helping his country, his state and his city, and is so honored, that by the time of his death he is  honored by a statue.  Sort of like the Prodigal Son, isn't it?   Perhaps we should find more citizens like this and put up more statues."
40220,"The key word is ""interpreted"" and who will be doing the interpreting. it's sad that any artwork will be sensored and we would mute any views, even if we disagree with them. I find many things offensive, but am civilized enough to realize my views and my ""interpretations"" may not be the same as others and they have a right to their opinion. From what I recall, no one is being forced to view anything, if I see a painting or display I do not care for, I can continue walking or driving. Where does this end? someone will always be offended about something.   "
40206,"Opinions change.  Societal mores change. Art remains. Shall we be like ISIS and destroy historic art just because we disagree with the person who created it or with its topic¿  How about covering the nudity of Venus De Milo?  What about people who object to David in front of the local 21C?  A short sighted ""reviews of art based on a single topic of "" race"" smacks of a political agenda, not an honest effort for community involvement.that is beneath you Mayor Fischer ...Shame on you
By the way do you also intend to remove all of the historical markers that reference the downtown slave market or the underground railroad? What about the Rebecca Judah plaque in front of the JCC or the statue in front of the CathedraL?  Singling out one faith is divisive, isn't it?
And finally...General Castleman,s granddaughter lives right down the street from the statue.  Did you personally speak to the family before your announcement?  If you did not you failed in an essential test of your humanity and character and aren't the decent person I thought you were. Louisville is what we have grown to be over 200 years...and that includes our missteps along the way. Acknowledge the past and move forward but don't try to whitewash history by taking out the ugly parts  
"
40214,"In response to the Mayor's request for discussion and opinions on public art I'd like to offer my opinion.  First of all, let's call it what it is.  It's not a public art issue, it's a race issue ; an issue that in most other cities like ours are being forced to deal with.  Why is it that some people insist that any part of history they don't agree with or don't like should be destroyed?  Aren't they the same people usually that push their own agenda on local governments to do things they believe.  We give plenty of attention to the citizens that talk the loudest and insist they are to be heard and their demands are to be met.  All the while refusing to accept that history can not be changed.  Just removing a statue or a picture or any kind of art will not change the facts.  Why do they think theirs is the only history that matters?  If we're going to go as far as removing any figures or symbols of important people that influenced history then we should also be willing to have statues of their leaders removed. Right here in our own town, we could start by tearing down the Muhammad Ali Center, then move on to the statue of York who helped lead the Lewis and Clark expedition.  I'm offended that there's not representation of the actual explorers. In the state of West Virginia we will need to take down the statue of John Henry, since he is not important to history in the opinions of many.  After all, he's only a folk hero.  

If we can't have our hero's, if we can't preserve our history and if we can't get together as real people and decide what's really important then we're doomed to failure.  We, citizens of this town also have a right to preserve our culture whether it's good, bad or ugly.    "
40205,"Most people in my friends group are condemning Castleman as a racist through hearsay.  Please don't let the mob of lies tarnish and rewrite our history.  I found this excerpt about Castleman that anecdotally gives an anti-racist view of him:

Black Louisvillian William Glass was visiting his hometown after being newly commissioned at the black officers training camp at Fort Des Moines. Walking down the street with his wife, he took offense when two white non-commissioned officers saluted a white officer but one of them refused to salute Glass saying ""I don't salute a Negro."" Before this incident Glass had always been saluted appropriately.
To ameliorate the situation, the venerable General John Breckenridge Castleman spoke out. A former Confederate major and commander of the famous ""Louisville Legion"" during the Spanish-American war, Castleman asserted that army discipline had to be maintained, which required the proper saluting of officers ""without regard to the color of their skin."""
,"If we are to remove all the statues that has to do with slavery then we must remove all the statues that has to do with Martin Luther King because he started a lot of riots over race and there was a lot of people killed under him over race. Do I want any of any of the history statues removed No, but fair is fair. Now to   destroy all the history school books will be next , when will it stop??"
40241,The statues represent history and are not nor have they ever been an endorsement of bigotry or racism.  WHAT A WASTE OF TIME AND TAX PAYER  RESOURCES ON SUCH AN ABSURD ASSUMPTION. 
40241,"With the skyrocketing murder rate the obvious solution is to remove statues and other art. Seriously, you have bigger problems. quit pandering with ""look at me, I'm so cool"" ideas and effect culture change. You are attempting to sanitize history. You cannot seriously think the problems in your city will vanish because of your feel,good actions. "
40207,"What lunacy. Why do we want to remove our history, and why does the city continue to pander to the fringe and specialty groups. I am ashamed to say I was born and raised here and I am 62 years old. "
40059," I would like to see all Confederate statues placed in a museum that would be quality-built and be a real attraction. There could be a nominal fee for entrance and an additional fee if you wanted the guided tour with headphones with a first class tour guide, someone of the quality of the History Channel narrator. Let this be a learning experience. Plus the magnitude of all the statues together would give a more comprehensive understanding of the Old South."
40229,"The statues erected to honor Confederate soldiers that were instrumental during the Civil War are also being remembered for their contributions to this great state and city.  The ""Trend"" to remove them is solely based upon a tide of destructive behavior.  The desecration of U.S. history needs to stop or what will the direction be tomorrow?  To target religious symbols and cleanse them from existence? "
40243,"Absolutely, take them all down: all the statues of defenders of slavery. All of them. They are an abomination; a glorification of a lost cause that was organized to defend a profound evil.  Our children see them. Take them all down.  "
40220,"Be on the right side of history. Take this statue down. He was a racist, Confederate traitor. Statues in public squares have never been erected to teach a history lesson; they are erected to honor and venerate. So many overtly racist comments arguing to leave the statue should be a hint as to whether or not Confederate statues have any place in our community. If you want Louisville to be a compassionate city, start by not exalting a traitorous segregationist that fought to keep people enslaved."
40220,"Please leave the art alone. There is history in everyone, a story to be told. Even if there is a Confederate piece of art, we all must remember that the Confederate lost. The true story to be told from all Confederate statues is that the North won. The people that stood behind freedom for all people won that war. Also, Americans died on both sides of the battle. They died for what they believed in and no matter right or wrong, it should be respected. History is exactly that.... history. Don't go tearing art down to try and erase it. "
40213,"The statues are a part of history.  Like it or not the history happened, there were two sides to the conflict.  Are we going to tear down anything and everything that had to do with the civil war, George Washington owned slaves, Tomas Jefferson owned slaves, do we tear down their statues, burn their books or do we act like adults with some sense and realize this is an event that happened.  People on the confederate side have a right to honor their fallen soldiers.  The people in political power are wrong to try to take down the statues just to further their own political agenda.  The statues were not erected to honor Bigotry, Racism, or Slavery, they were put there to honor the many fallen confederate soldiers who gave their life fighting for what they believed in at that time in history.  IT'S HISTORY FOLKS, GET OVER IT!!!!!!!!!!"
,"New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu said it perfectly:

""They are not just innocent remembrances of a benign history. These monuments purposefully celebrate a fictional, sanitized Confederacy, ignoring the death, ignoring the enslavement and the terror that it actually stood for. After the Civil War, these statues were a part of that terrorism as much as a burning cross on someone’s lawn; they were erected purposefully to send a strong message to all who walked in their shadows about who was still in charge in this city."""
40207,"Let the statues stand and educate the public on the accomplishments of each so they don't focus on the negative. 

It is a disgrace that hometown heroes across the country are not getting any respect.

These people lived in past times, fought for our country to make it what it is today...they are veterans...they were community leaders...they were family men and women... and the disrespect of them should stop. 

In the end...all of the hatred toward each other needs to stop. Once people can accept that there are different points of view from different people, and that is OK, and we can all live together in this great country, it will be a much better place. 

"
40205,Please leave the artwork alone. You cannot and should not erase history. There will always be something that offends someone. 
40241,"Please remove any confederate statues/monuments in Louisville/Jefferson County. They are symbols of oppression and are not art. If Louisville is truly a city of ""compassion"" we should be leaders in removing relics of hate and bigotry."
,"Any art that is of historical value needs to be preserved. If you start omitting certain pieces solely due to a few people being offended, then you better remove ALL that has anything to do with raced regardless of which group wants it.

Those that forget history are doomed to repeat it. You can't appease everyone, so quit trying to appease only one group. Any art that glorifies one group over all others is an affront to ALL citizens, black, white, Asian, etc...

If you allow white only art, then the blacks will be offended. If you allow black, then the whites will be offended, and so on.

Quit pandering to the special interest groups for the sole reason to pander to them for their votes. Start being leaders and quit catering to political correctness."
40220,"I'm getting really tired of big city politicians playing race cards, and using their public office to cater or patronize specific groups of people. I am white and was raised in Old Louisville. History is what it was, not what it is. Stop catering to the destruction. Aren't you remotely intelligent enough to realize, that to those who are destroying property, this isn't about history, slavery or race. It's simply about being destructive. Take down all of the statues, and then what's next? They are never going to be content. They will find something else to protest and destroy. Why don't city officials concentrate on dealing with the drugs and violence that paralyze the city. I've lived here all my life. Thanks to the behavior of our city leaders, and the violence in this city, that has not been addressed properly, we are moving out. In short order, my entire family will be out of Jefferson County completely. Thanks for abandoning us tax payers."
40059,"Bowing to radicals only exacerbates a problem. The historical art the mayor and a few radicals have become so concerned about have been in place for approximately 100 years causing no concern or harm. This art is just like a gun . Until someone picks it up it causes no harm .  The radical's need to shout and gain attention has created this problem. Its history people! History!

For example, Lexington wants to move two sculptures from their Courthouse lawn. However, while that building is being renovated into the Welcome Center for Lexington it should be noted that that land was the largest slave trading market in the area. Welcome to Lexington the sign will say.

We're doing the same thing to ourselves. It is impossible to change history. What we have to do is change our state of mind  and learn from  our history  to improve the future.

Question:  is Jefferson Street next to be given, probably, an African American name?  Will referring to our Southend become a biased statement? Will we have to call it something like the ""closer to Tennessee end"".  Will our National White House be renamed?

A gun causes no harm until someone picks it up. A knife causes no harm until someone picks it up. A flag causes no harm until someone picks it up. These sculptures have caused no harm until someone got bored recently and needed excitement in their life. And now for a few the landscape of Louisville is changing. Ridiculous and unfair and totally unnecessary."
40204-2119,"I am a staunch preservationist and have been a co-chair of the CTA Art Fair for 20 years.
I've done a lot of soul searching on removing the Castleman Statue and have come to the conclusion that it is time to act and remove it.
Any monument that glorifies the confederacy or its supporters is now a rallying point for white supremacists.
It would be one thing if Castleman ""reformed"" after the war, but the record shows something different:
http://www.courier-journal.com/story/opinion/contributors/2017/05/26/give-andrew-cowan-statue-thank-him-parks-eric-burnette/323825001/
Please read the above. it closes with:
""We often look back at people like Castleman and shrug and say “ah, well, he was a man of his time.” Perhaps that’s true. But there’s also something timeless about greed and self-dealing; about ignorance and intolerance. Time is no excuse.""
The time is right to do what's right. I used to love the sight of the monument, but now recognize that it enables, encourages and acts as a rallying point for the worst voices in our society, even though they may not be citizens of our immediate community. It is a painful open wound for African Americans who endure the indignity of having symbols of their abuse and oppression publicly supported and displayed. We have the duty to remove it and replace it with something emblematic of what is right in our past, present and future."
40223,"This man may have been in the Confederate Army that lasted 4 years,but the United States saw enough good in him to Pardon him, to forgive,him that  in itself is something we ll need to learn.. This man fought for the USA in the Spanish/ American War. He brought us our beautiful Parks, Cherokee, Seneca, even donating the land for Tyler...He brought us Olmsted, Saddlebreds and so much more... He graduated from U of L Law School . He was a renowned businesses man and a pillar of a man in our community. This statue is not something that looks down upon anyone, it should stand for the good in everyone and forgiveness ... "
40229,"Almost every historical statue and monument has some past ugliness associated with it. Daniel Boone participated in the atrocities against Native Americans and is a celebrated ""Indian killer""; Lewis and Clark used slaves for their expedition; Washington was a slave owner; King Louis XVI participated in slavery. You cant change history or rewrite history. History should remind us of our past so you do not make the same mistakes as our fathers. I am the silent majority, I will not be downtown doing counter-protesting the removal of Confederate Statues. I work 2 jobs so on the weekends and nights , I am at home resting but I do VOTE.   "
40117,I believe The Monuments should be left in place you can't run from or erase history there's no way these monuments should offend people it's no different than other things that offend people like adult bookstores and excetera if you don't want to see The Monuments or read what the placards have to say then don't go by them there's some people who respect history and see value in learning from it
40160,"If we are going to start moving and taking down statues because a small group of people want to protest, then let's make it fair take them all down. Sanitizing America because people disagree with our nations past will not fix what has happened, lets not forget that people of all colors carried the confederate battle flag of their own free will along with the American flag. Stop the Racism on all side, a raciest group turning to violence to move their point forward should be charged a domestic terrorist regardless of color. start charging the leaders of the group with what the group they are leading is doing and watch things change. Stop the racism!!!!!!!!!   "
40243,"I understand and appreciate the ability to engage in this dialog as being a basic Constitutional Right afforded all US Citizens.  That is the one of the Freedoms so many have fought and died for to protect.  I believe that all are created equal by our God and subject to equal treatment under our laws regardless of Race, Religion, Sex, etc. My issue here is we simply cannot deny that our history is what it is.  We should be free to learn from our past and not deny that it happened.  Eliminating any form of art that some might find offensive is a form of Historical Censorship which cannot be tolerated.  That is a path this great city and country should not travel upon.  Everyone can find something that offends them.  If I am offended by something, I do not expect the entire population to feel the same way and change something to appease me.  If we, as a city, decide upon taking this path.......What will be demanded of us next? Perhaps re-writing US history so nobody is offended?  Perhaps we shouldn't teach history in schools anymore and hope the bad stuff doesn't repeat itself?  Maybe the Germans should do away with Holocaust Memorials and bulldoze the concentration camp remains because it was a painful time in their country's history.  One could go on and on with the absurd infinitely.  The key is to use symbols, art, statues, that reflect our history (good or bad), as an opportunity to teach current and future generations the mistakes of our past, so the same mistakes don't happen again. Instead suppressing  the reality of what happened, let us learn from it.  "
40204,"I think that all statues of confederate soldiers or generals should be removed from public places. I don't necessarily think they should be destroyed, but taken down from ""honorary"" positions, like the statue in Cherokee Triangle."
40291,"I think the historical art is important to Kentucky History.  I'd rather see some educational materials available to explain the challenges our City/County/State experienced to make us what we are today.  The ""Whys"" behind the art.  It was a rough time: households were split and times were challenging.  People were scared on both sides of this drama.  What happened good and bad forced as citizens to make the changes that we wanted for our state - and these changes continue based on the goals of the citizens.

What if all of the conquerors of ancient wars/battles demolished all existing art/architecture in the past?  We'd have no Roman Monuments, no Greek ruins, no Moorish architecture, no cathedrals, no catacombs.  These are things that a civilization cherishes and we use that art to attempt to understand the people of that time.    "
40205,Leave our monuments and statues alone.. Good or bad its our history.. He represented more then just bad things in our history.. We must take the bad with the good.. I pass that statue several times a weeks.pasBeen there since 1913.. 
40204,"I am a resident of the Cherokee Triangle and do not support the removal of the Castleman statue. I do support the removal of Confederate statues. This is not a Confederate statue. We really need to stop and think before giving into an angry mob. If we can't base such decisions on the facts, then how are we better than those we oppose?"
40204,"Replace them with something new and more interactive, even if they were not celebrating slavery, they are not being looked at, guys on horses that have been here for 100 year is not inspiring, kindof boring, and we can do better. What about something we dont see everywhere?
"
40241,This is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard. You can't erase history. Most of the statue's that are being removed are of military leaders who fought in the civil war not because of slavery but because of their beliefs in states rights. To them that's what the war was about. Also are you going to remove everything to do with George Washington and Thomas Jefferson because they were a slave owners. Are we going to tear down the Great Pyramids in Egypt because they were built by slaves. Slaves were a part of the history of the world and yes we were one of the last countries to stop using them but this is no reason to remove all monuments that someone find offensive. Where do it stop?
40216,"Before removing ANY art or historical acknowledgements it should be researched.  

The reasons for the display of the art work or the acknowledgement of someone's life should be taken into consideration and maybe posted at the site of the art or acknowledgement.  This type of display is done at almost all current historical sites and should be available to all who view these displays.

We are losing sight of the real reasons these displays were originally created/commissioned and those reasons are/considered noteworthy enough that the display was created.  They were not just arbitrarily placed out in the public’s eye for all eternity.


"
40272,"   I consider art, all forms of art , to be things of beauty. The worth of Art, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder. If there were to be a piece of art portraying an individual(s) harming individuals as in the painting of ""Custer's Last Stand"" it may not be well received by everyone but there is a lesson to be learned from the painting about an actual, factual occurrence in history that gives it value and it should be preserved for posterity. 
   We have pictures of the Nazi concentration camps and gas chambers that document historical facts that some would like to forget or deny happened. They should be preserved as well. 
   There is nudity in the countless statues throughout China and Europe depicting lewd or vile sexual acts that many find deplorable and of no value whatsoever. They exist and are allowed to exist because they represent an event or a behavior of a particular time period. 
   The Art and public displays around Louisville should remain as they are so that they can be used by both those who love and hate them to teach whatever philosophy they are trying to promote and we as citizens have the freedom to accept or reject them but NOT to DESTROY or REMOVE them.
   We have groups condemning white supremacy and racism and then they get the taxpayers to fund programs that establish the very thing they are criticizing, a case in point is the new JCPS school for black males. How can this not be racism?
   We see signs and tee shirts stating that ""Black Lives Matter"", why not ""ALL LIVES MATTER"" but then that would include the unborn fetuses in the womb and we are not about to go there.
    I believe change is a good thing if it is done with the sole intent to improve or raise the value/worth of a program, person, place or thing. To remove something because it is offensive to an individual or group is not a solution but an action that only causes more unrest and conflict between those who like and those who detest that item or issue.
    Art is a lesson in history, and history should never be ignored.   "
42718,"What difference does it make what comments are given here. Fischer has already proven that, in an attempt to secure the West End vote, he will remove any statue or art work the ""black community"" decide is offensive to them. Did he ask anybody about the Third Street monument? He is a liberal Democrat and ""the second blackest white man in Louisville"", shortly behind Terry Meiners of your Louisvillain culture. Destroy the statues............ it won't change history at all."
40220,"I once lived in the shadow of this statue.  I think it is ridiculous to think removing monuments will somehow change history. We must remember what happen in order to change the future. John Breckinridge Castleman did a lot of good for our city and we need to remember that part and have meaningful dialog about what and why he did the other things he did. 
I think defacing public property should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. Two wrongs DO NOT make a right!
"
40220,"Please do not remove ANY historical statues.  It makes me physically ill to think of Gen. Castleman's statue of beautiful Caroline being removed.  Or any other artwork.  Leave history alone!!!!!!!  Why does one groups opinion matter more than another groups opinion?  I was very against removing the Confederate monument and feel sad every time I drive by the location on ""Confederate Place"". My parents were UL graduates and their fraternity and sorority houses were on Confederate Place and I spent a lot of time there as a child . They would have been appalled to know what is going on in this city.  I'm glad they are no longer here to see what is happening. My family has lived in the Louisville area  for seven generations.  I have relatives that fought on both sides in the Civil War. I do not condone racism and feel that slavery was abhorrent.  I try my best not to judge anyone and try to love all people.  However I am almost ashamed to be a Louisvillian. And I am ashamed of our city. I no longer think that it is a great place to live.  It has become a violent, ugly place with trash everwhere and rude, mean people."
40213,"I am not a bigot, racist, nor would I ever condone slavery in any form.  However I am concerned that removing these historical artifacts will be a digression for the city and it's residents.  Sanitizing the city by removing the historical art may help ease the burden on some shoulders, but it could open the door for a society ignorant of it's past mistakes, and doomed to repeat history.  I think Louisville should invest in a historical museum to house such artifacts and open it to the public that may want to visit and understand the historical value of the events and people during those crucial developmental years of our country.  An example that comes to mind is the Holocaust Museum in Washington D.C.  Is it promoting the condemnation of Jews.  No it is demonstrating to society what took place during that dark period of our history.  Doing something like this could indeed protect our history from vandals and other attacks.  It also could be a revenue generator for the city.  I have a framed Courier-Journal newspaper from 1941 hanging in my living room with a headline that states ""Roosevelt Pledges Aid to Crush Hitler"".  The newspaper was saved by my grandmother who had four sons, all of whom fought in WWII, one of them was a prisoner of war for two years.  Every day I look at it and I am reminded of the strength and courage of my father's generation.  They gave selflessly, many even gave their life for our freedoms.  We can not forget that or any other historical values given to us as remembrances of past generations.  We are our history.  We are where we are because of our history.  We can not erase it, sanitize it, or forget it.  Doing so would doom us to a future ignorant of our past, and likely to repeat those mistakes."
40212,I believe all art and STATUES SHOULD remain.WE may not like what happened years ago but its all part of HISTORY.ITS WRONG TO TRY TO CHANGE IT.WE must all forgive the past AND LIVE IN PEACE.
40217,"Since returning to Louisville in 2016, after living outside of KY since 2013, I have gleaned that this city is a progressive one which prides itself on being a safe space. A space that is non-discriminatory to people of color or people who have different religious and ethnic backgrounds and beliefs. However, racism, bigotry, and ideals related to white supremacy fall under a different type of belief system - one that should not be tolerated in the slightest or supported in anyway. 

The Civil War is defined by Wikipedia as ""the result of a long-standing controversy over slavery and states' rights"". The Confederacy was not only the losing side in this long-standing battle, but also the wrong side. Their belief system stood on the pillars of bigotry, racism, and white supremacy. Any side that considers other human being lives to have less worth because of their skin color or religious association is the wrong side. 

In my humble opinion, I think that the Castleman Monument should be removed from the City of Louisville. It is a symbol of the wrong side of history that we are, sadly, still dealing with parallels of today. Prior to the domestic terrorist attack in Charlottesville, the Castleman Monument was used as a meeting place for racists, bigots, and Nazis in the city. Since the attack, it has drawn even more negative attention including it being recently vandalized in protest to its existence. The longer it stands in Cherokee Triangle, the longer the Nazi party and all other deplorable groups of bigots and racists that build their audiences on the ideals of white pride will think they have a place in Louisville, KY. And they do not. "
40204,"I live two blocks from the statue. The debate about the statue seems to be between whether he was or was not a confederate general, but he was a ""good man in his role in the Olmsted Parks"".

Instead of talking about his role in the confederacy, I want to discuss his role in the park system. Castleman sold his land to the park commission to make way for Tyler Park. In exchange for selling his land, he placed a lein that a street on the plot would be named after him (Now known as Castlewood). Also, he paid off a Courier Journal writer to say that he donated the land for the park (which he certainly did not).  He obstructed Frederick Law Olmsted's plans for Iroquois park, Cherokee Park, & Shawnee Park. He facilitated the segregation of Louisville's tennis courts and other public spaces, and was overall a corrupt businessman sticking his dirty fingers in the pie of local public works. He was not a good person. The residents of Cherokee Triangle deserve a better role model riding down one of our most beloved parkways on a horse than this man. Take it down."
40216,"Leave our History alone . There is No reason to move .
"
40047,"I strongly oppose any monument that glorifies the Confederacy, Confederate Soldiers, their acts, actions, victories, and defeats. These items belong in museum, where they can be placed in appropriate historical context, not on our streets, sidewalks, parks, and public buildings. No amount of civic pride or action can undo the work of men who would conspire and fight to keep other humans in chains.

We have better civic heroes to honor than these men, including but not limited to John B. Castleman. 

I support the removal of these monuments at any public cost."
40205,"A review of public art and other symbols sanctioned by a government is a good thing.  Suggest:  1). so that we do not give  the appearance of rewriting history can we review each piece with an eye to what contributions the individual made that enhanced the overall good of the community.  For example, despite Castleman's service in the confederacy did he demonstrate a shift in beliefs by serving the US Army later as well as improve Louisville overall.  If you can answer yes, then maybe those people that are memorialized can remain because they publicly redeemed themselves in the direction of good.  If you cannot answer yes, then maybe such statues should be relegated to a warehouse or a place where they are reviewed in context of their history (confederate museum, etc).   2).  Public art symbolizes what a place believes at the time.  It's important to do the review, but it really is the surface of an underlying belief system and does not go far enough to change the fundamental reasons public art is being debated in the first place.  3). As part of the review, instead of removing can we look at including to give a more complete and accurate look at history.  Where are the statues of famous women?  Louisville was in and around the Underground Railroad, where is Harriet Tubman or other key figures in that effort?  Can we look at how to include memorials to all people and how they enhanced the US or the state or the city?   4). How statues are depicted can be better explained in the accompanying plaques--explain the rationale more completely, both good and bad, so that future generations understand the historical context and the reasoning behind the memorial at the time it was put in place.  Create a living time capsule that explains the time."
40241,Leave it alone.  I don't hardly ever agree with what President Trump says but I did agree with him when he said where is it going to end. e.g.  take all tributes to Washington and Jefferson down. 
40245,Leave things along. History is what it is you can't change it but seeing it and studying it can help stop repeating it 
40205,"I do not condone the removal of our heritage with no regard for public opinion, so am happy to see the Mayor address that here. Thank you. This is not a racial issue. These monuments are a part of American history, and indeed Louisville's, they convey stability in our community as recognizable landmarks for generations. It is sad to see such anger directed at the John B. Castleman statue by a few activists and vandals. I hope the city takes the temperature of ALL it's residents on this issue, most would probably rather it disappear as fast as it appeared. regards, Robin     "
40205,"Where will this end? Renaming of roads, buildings, bridges, burning of books all because some people are offended of our nations history?  We need the good and bad reminders so we don't forget how we got here! "
40204,"I've been a member of the Cherokee Triangle since 2009; while I can't afford property there, I live in an apartment building at the corner of Baringer Avenue and Willow. I love this neighborhood so, so much. It's incredibly important to me, and it is truly my home.

The Castleman Statue has been the centerpiece of the neighborhood for over 100 years. It's a beautiful piece of art, and the Triangle would not be the same without it. The idea of it being absent makes my stomach hurt. 

I urge you to not dismantle history, but instead build for the future. For every citizen offended by this statue, build another featuring someone they revere and celebrate. There are plenty of areas in Louisville where such monuments could be erected, and this could serve as a very important part of Mayor Fischer's legacy - the monuments movement. 

Taking away the Castleman Statue would do nothing but deepen the already substantial divide between Louisvillians. As far as fighting ignorance and hate, it would honestly solve nothing. There has to be a way we can battle bigotry without erasing history. 

I'd also like to comment on the slippery slope this represents - where does it end? Will the Thomas Jefferson monument in front of Metro Hall be next? How about Daniel Boone at the entrance of Cherokee Park? Censoring public art is against what we stand for, and while some interpret it as a representation of bigotry, many other see it in a completely different light. Who are any of us to decide what it truly stands for? Who are any of us to censor art? This is not the way. 

Our community needs to understand that there are things worse than taking offense - censorship being one of them. I am offended by things everyday, including the loud, abrasive gathering that was recently held around the Castleman Statue. However, because I do not agree with these individuals does not make me think that I have the right to shut down their ability to speak their mind.

I wonder, do any of them actually live in the neighborhood? Did they know who John Castleman was before the monument was vandalized? Or are they simply bandwagoners looking for a cause to scream about?

I detest racism and hatred as much as anyone, but this is not the way to fight it. I urge our community leaders, and especially our Mayor, to make the right choice and leave the monument be. I can assure you that there are more people who want it to stay than there are want it to go (those, like me, who want it to stay are just not as loud and not as abrasive as the other side). 

If you choose to move this monument, you will be leaving a huge portion of this (level-headed) community behind. Please do the right thing and don't give in to the fundamentalist rhetoric.   "
40272,"This is ridiculous.  Anybody can manipulate and interpret anything as ""racist.""  We see it all the time.  Your placating these people only encourages them.  The thought of a government official ""reviewing"" art to see if it ""offends"" radicals is absolutely horrifying.  We are truly becoming all the enemies we have fought as a nation.

Sickening.  Leave our history and our art alone!"
,"I adore the city of Louisville and the progress being made to ensure the city is a progressive, inclusive place for all people to come together. In celebrating progress however, I don't think there is any place to commemorate the mistakes of the past. It feels counterproductive when statues celebrating the Confederacy, and an attack on our nation, are championed openly. We cannot erase our past, but we can learn from it. These statues and memorials should be removed from public spaces and instead relocated to museums where they belong - in the past, to tell the story of our history. They should not be left out in the city where they can be mistaken as celebratory or to say that the people of Louisville support their behaviors. Be like Baltimore. Remove and relocate the statues. If a relocation plan cannot be enacted quickly, store them until something can be sorted out. Please set an example for the state and the nation."
40204,"I live in the Cherokee Triangle and I think the Castleman statue is a wonderful piece of art that enhanced our neighborhood.  BUT, if the statue is now seen to be supporting the bigots who sow hate and fear in our community, and if it memorializes a part of our history that gives pain to many of my neighbors and friends, then I support removing it.  General Castleman and his business cronies erected the statue during his lifetime with their own funds -- a rather vainglorious deed.  His factual accomplishments do not appear to merit the praise that the statue and accompanying plaque imply.  I don't think it's appropriate to memorialize a man who was first a traitor to his country and then, after being pardoned for his deeds, used his subsequent military position to build his personal fortune.  I would much rather see another beautiful sculpture in that space, perhaps one that memorializes the Native Americans for whom our park and neighborhood are named?"
40291,"  I don't understand how a minority always has the right to go against a majority of people on so many issues.  If you took a vote in Louisville I'm sure the majority would vote to keep the statues.  As many have said,  ""Where will this stop?  Where will it end?"" All this is subjective thinking.  we have already removed one statue from 3rd St.  That was not enough.  What will be enough?  You are appointing a committee to decide.  Just how diverse is that committee?  I shudder to think whom you have picked to decide the fate of our beautiful city and our historical monuments.  Those statues have stood for many, many years.  What has happened?  What has changed?  If you asked the people protesting to give you a full history of the statues of the people they are tearing down...they wouldn't know anything past slavery.  If a statue can upset people that badly, they have more problems mentally for which they should seek help than that.  

Mayor, where is your backbone?  Afraid you'll lose some votes?  You have definitely lost mine if statues continue to be removed!!!!"
40059,"Please consider that art is speech in a physical form. Just because one does not like what is depicted that is not a reason to censor it.  Removing art in any form does not lessen what offends.  Art depicts daily events, imagined or real and is history seen through the eyes of the artist.  Good, bad or ugly, history happened.  Life does not come with a giant eraser, to permit us to erase the past.  Remember, books were condemned and burned prior to World War II, will the Public Library be next in line for censorship?"
40204,"Families who opposite sides of the Civil War managed to reunite following it to become dedicated citizens. Remember the Civil War was more about commerce than slavery. Cotton and tobacco sales to England and Europe depended  on cheap labor.  My family freed their slaves many years before the war and paid them for their labor. We face similar issues now with migrant farm workers, etc. General Castleman did a wonderful job for our city after the war. He was instrumental in buying property for and setting up our park system. He brought  Cherokee Park to our and his front door.  We in the Triangle live on his property and I thank that statue every time I pass it for his vision. 

"
40204,"Regardless of his failings (and most white citizens of an earlier time shared them) , Castleman and Carolina have come to embody not a racist past but a cherished symbol of a flourishing, caring and diverse neighborhood.  We have owned our 110-year-old home two blocks away for 36 years and raised three children there.  Our kids and grandkids know and care nothing of that statue's history, only that it is a beacon of home."
40204,"Castleman should come down.

He spent years of his life trying to kill U.S. soldiers in an effort to perpetuate a system where people of color where chattel, raped and killed with impunity, whose infants were ripped from them and sold to the highest bidder.  There is no indication that he ever regretted or was remorseful for his conduct in the Civil War.

I love our parks, but even if Castleman were solely responsible for them (and he's not), he does not deserve a statute. Folks talk about Daniel Boone and Jefferson as slave owners, which is true and terrible, but Castleman's conduct occurred decades later and when he had the clear option of siding with Lincoln. Plus, Boone's and Jefferson's positive contributions far exceed Castleman's."
40204,"I understand both sides of the argument. To me the fact that he is in riding clothes says a lot. It is not specifically a monument glorifying him being a confederate soldier. He has done a lot for the surrounding area, as well as the American Saddlebred association...those accomplishments should be the focus of the plaque. He was a Didier but it just for the confederate army (which he was pardoned) but for the US...again, maybe a change to the plaque would bring light to that. My only concern is that he was very much supportive and apparently vocal about segregation. I want to memorilize someone that wanted seperate tennis courts at Cherokee park... My suggestion would be to make signifigant changes to the plaque. Many people didn't even know who the statue was of until recently...or who he was. I think a lot of this is being sensationalized due to recent events...however if the statue is left and keeps getting vandeized, there's not point keeping it. It will just cost money to repair and look ugly in the meantime. Any chance we could take him off the horse and just have a Saddlebred statue? Castle Kent could still be mentioned in the plaque for helping start the horse association, as well as developing parks in the Highlands.  If there are specific monuments in Louisville memorilizing conferderate soldiers or in any way tied to slavery and racism, I do believe they need to be removed. It's not erasing history just because there isn't a physical marker for it, but I don't believe we need to pay tribute to those soldiers and men. We are a growing and changing country and it would be nice to have monuments that represent that....or even showcasing some of our talented artists with art installations and sculpture. I'd love to see more of that!"
40216,"Leave the art alone. It is part of our First Amendment rights. Yes some bad things have happen in America and some of that art work depicts that. It also shows how we have over come that period too. A descendant of a rebel soldier has every right to have a statue of something from his past just as much as a black man does. You people are trying to wipe out the white race. A big problem in America today is we try to make everybody feel good, but bad things happen and we can't hide that. BLM is a hate group just like KKK is but we want to destroy KKK and not BLM. I think a person is pathetic if a statue or piece of cloth makes them feel bad. Grow up people. "
40218,"If we are to start removing anything of historical signifigance that may or may not offend anyone from this current time based solely on the assumption of offense you must remove EVERY one of the statues and anything named for any slave owners as well as anyone that supported manifest destiny and other attrocities visited upon any ""minority"". 

As such the following are deemed ""offensive"": 
George Rogers and Merriwether Clark (owned a slave 'York"" for those of you who were not aware), 
George Washington, 
Thomas Jefferson, 
King Loiuis XVI (the man the city is named for), 
Daniel Boone, 
Andrew Jackson, 
The Filsons (as in the 'historical society'), 
Many, many, more

Good luck! The city of New Orleans just spent $2 Million, to remove three statues and relocate them to a scrap yard. What the city DESPERATELY needs is a new pumping station, seeing as they needed a new one when Hurricane Katrina breeched the levees. It has never been updated or replaced. Now $2 Million later, no water pumps, flooded city OVER $2 Million in damages....

Our city can be the same. What we really need, is some hardcore common sense. If an object offends you, AVOID the darn thing. Teach your children WHY it offends you. Teach and learn folks, or ignore and dismantle. Either way you can not change the past."
40215,"The statues NEEDS TO STAY AND BE PROTECTED PERIOD!! ANYONE who doesnt like it can look the other way!! i know people want them to go BUT what about the people who wants them to stay?? Dont WE count or are the officials going to put their big pants on and tell them that they CANNOT rewrite HISTORY and dictate on what is going to go and what will stay?!?! no matter what ALL the wars happened!! people seem to forget that there were MORE Irish slaves and Japanese slaves than there were black slaves and there was American indian slaves...so IF they try and erase history then slavery didnt happen either...right?? The statues NEEDS to stay...vandals needs to be caught and have jail time. IF statues needs to be gone so does ALL of them INCLUDING any and all pro muslim...pro black...pro gay...IF you dont, can you imagine what would happen if you dont?? you CANT cater to ONE race WITHOUT catering to all!! There are so so many MORE people in Louisville that wants to keep our historic statues than there are that wants them gone...NAMELY OUR VETERANS...how THEY feel is just as important as the ones who wants them gone IF NOT MORE!! Our Vets have been put down so many times over and they all feel like this would be just another dumbing down of them and making THEM feel less important if they are taken away. WHY do you think there was Vets trying to save the Monument a few years ago on 2nd street?? i have many Vets on my Facebook..MANY MANY VETS and THEY want the statues to stay...THEY are in an uproar over them possibly coming down. You cant please everyone...BUT cant you please our Vets for once and for the ones who does want them to stay?? Doesnt lawmakers know how to stand up and put their foot down and say that the statues ARE a part of history and they are going to stay?? so what..the people owned slaves...they also owned Irish slaves more because they were cheaper!! but the schools and people arent being taught this...how do i know?? because MY anchestors were Irish...thats how i know!! So DO THE RIGHT THING AND KEEP THE STATUES!!"
40291,"Any statue dedicated to a member of the CSA is an affront to the memory of those that did NOT commit treason. The CSA was a gang of treasonous losers. If we are going to allow statues to those that we fought against - how about we have a North Vietnamese General or a German from WWI or WWII placed there as well. The CSA = TREASON. The only reason they all were not hanged at the end of the war was to unite the country. They all should have been hanged. Lee, Davis - the entire group of treasonous slugs HANGED. We wouldn't be in this mess now if they would have just hanged the lot."
40205,"The statue is a part of our history and a prominent presence in the triangle. If we start letting groups dictate HOW we record,and remember history, we may as well determine that history doesn't matter to us. I'm sure someone, somewhere is offended by Hogans fountain, Daniel Boone statue, the playgrounds in the park.... where Dover draw the line ? IF the John Castleman statue is so offensive, we should have had this discussion BEFORE it was erected... BEFORE thousands of dollars were spent to preserve it. In my opinion, the vandalism of the statue is way more offensive than the statue itself. "
40229,"I believe that none of the statues should have been taken down. They are not a picture of racism but a picture of history. No matter how hard you try, history will always stand."
40204,"Re the statue at the entrance to Cherokee Park: John Castleman is not in any uniform. He was a man that lived around this area. He did fight in the Civil War, but so did many men of his time. The statue has nothing to do with the Civil War nor segregation. I checked on Ancestry.com- newspaper section. According to the newspaper reports Castleman was quite a contributor to Louisville, especially this area. I have lived ""near"" the statue for over 50 years. It is a landmark, signature piece. Beautiful horse with an interesting period costume on the rider. We must be careful about removing all signs of beauty and our past. We can not let thoughtless vandals direct our lives. Perhaps, as many have suggested, an additional plaque stating more clearly who Castleman was would add to the value of the statue. Which cost $15,000.00 in 1913!!! I am 100% opposed to removing the statue."
40014,I do not want Civil War statues from either side removed. I honor the men who fought and died for their beliefs. 
40204,"Please leave Statues in place. Cannot erase
History. This is the most ridiculous thing I
have ever seen. Spend taxes on feeding the 
poor and homrless.  Cherokee Parkway is in 
need of lighting and paving. Concentrate on
stopping crime in our city, especially the west
end. "
40242,"History is history, you can't change it or erase it. The statues are not hurting anyone. Leave them be. Slavery was abolished 150 plus years ago. There will always be societal divisions and removing statues, public art, will not change that. Why not leave them to remind us where we were and use that to help us strive to get to where we want to be, because ALL lives matter."
40205,"Any and all public art that implies racism/white supremacy either implicitly or explicitly should go. This is to include the Castleman Statue on Cherokee in the Highlands. 

To the argument that it should stay to teach history, I say, there is a difference between teaching history and glorifying historical figures. There are better concepts that could be immortalized in this prominent public space. What we need is a better tomorrow and we need public art that inspires that. What will be history is what we do today.

Regardless of any pardon the president gave Castleman, regardless that this man helped provide parks and tennis courts to white people he was still a racist/white supremacist. It is for sure privilege that white people living in the Highlands are not and have never been affected directly by such evil acts as the kind Castleman put forth and therefore have never really thought about it before. It's time we not only think about this but act in the most responsible way. Take it down.

The statue of of George Prentice outside the downtown Louisville library should also come down. His own paper during his lifetime called him a bigot. He was pro-slavery, anti-Catholic and anti-immigrant. He helped incite the Bloody Monday riot of 1855. Take it down.
"
40214,"If you are going to continue to remove anything that may offend any part of the Louisville population, you had better plan on burning the history books too. Slavery happened all over the World, and still happening today in some areas. Bigotry, and racism, will continue until this World collapses. Taking down statues that have stood silent for over a century, have now become abrasive to the new generation of blacks, and whites. What is the saying? ""history tends to repeat itself."" It will, if we have no history to fall back on in years to come."
40272,"It may not be part of your heritage, but leave mine alone and stop trying to sanitize history"
40258,"I am so upset that we are taking down statues of historical people. I wonder what will be next if we give in to this destruction. First the statue that stood on So 3rd St for years. When in school we were taught and tested on history studied. It was all history not redirected do to judgement of what they did wrong but the part they played in history. Why waste time in a history class if it is going to be dismissed by protest in the future.The statues represent history. You know if we let people rule what we have as part of history and destroy or move these statues what will we destroy next. I say if you don't agree with it stay away but if you enjoy history and have been taught about it then we have the right to leave it where it was initially set for people to see. This country was founded by historians and we need to stop moving and destroying what we learned in school. Please stop giving into these people who can not respect history and forgive those that made mistakes. Will we in years to come destroy monuments of well know historians in decades more recent, such as JFK, Libraries named in honor of Presidents. Come on people in the USA , IT'S ARE FREEDOM TO SEE, STUDY AND LEARN ABOUT HISTORY AND MISTAKES THAT WERE MADE AND GROW TO BE THE BEST COUNTRY AND VISIT HISTORICAL MUSEUMS AND MONUMENTS. "
40214,"All Confederate art must be relocated to area like cemetery or museum. Public education on Jim Crow, Segregation and the reason art was put up (intimidation of AAs) should be overwhelming beforehand to prevent violence. Lectures, live, streaming, written, one on one, etc should saturate public beforehand on AA history, horrors of WWII and Nazis, slavery, Confederacy."
40291,Stop trying to erase history to please a few that seem to view everything as being racist. 
40217,"Removing Confederate Memorials is NONSENSE!!

History should be learned from to prevent us from making he same mistakes.  Erasing history is ridiculous!!

These statues do not glorify racism, nor do they promote hatred.  They are intended to memorials to soldiers who lost their lives in a Civil War that pitted brother against brother in some cases, especially in Kentucky.

Being an American is NOT easy.  We must defend the rights of people espousing concepts and ideas that make our blood boil in order to protect the First Amendment.   

DO NOT REMOVE CONFEDERATE WAR MEMORIALS!!  
"
40242,Please do not remove any statues pertaining to the Confederacy or Civil War. They are important parts of our history.
40219,"The government should not be removing and/or destroying monuments pertaining to the civil war. Unfortunately the civil war did happen and unfortunately slavery was allowed in this country, it is a part of our history and shouldn't be erased from public knowledge or view. If it is felt a more detailed explanation of the events or people these monuments are based on is need then place an educational plaque on them. Many of the people honored in confederate monument did much after the war to reunite the country and make the country a better place."
40118,I disagree with confederate monuments being removed.
,"Leave it alone.  It's part of the city/state's history and legacy.  Should we get rid of the Washington monument because GW owned slaves?  If you give into these demands, it will never stop.  First they will want to ban statues.  Then they will want to ban books.  Finally they will want to ban ideas.

Confront the past, good or bad, and accept it.  It is a daily reminder of history and change.  

Removing these statues won't make life better for anyone.  A certain segment just wants to exert power and influence in a banal expression of ego.

John Breckenridge Castleman's statue isn't there because of his civil war record.  It's there because of the good things he did after that to build Louisville.   Tyler Park used to be his land, and no, he never owned slaves."
40216,All statues should stay. Do Not Remove!! Do Not Erase History!!! The statues honor the men who fought for their country. They may have been on the wrong side but they still should be honored for their service.

40204,"While I have fondness for the Castleman equestrian statue as a handsome landmark in my neighborhood, in view of the temper of these times, I cannot support retaining it. He was responsible for segregating the Olmsted parks.

I would suggest that in its place, a statue of Frederick Law Olmsted be erected. He was the father of landscape architecture and an abolitionist as well."
40205,"This is an opportunity for Louisville to demonstrate how compassionate it really is. Take them down, and disavow the suffering and divisiveness they represent. "
40223,"I am very concerned about your desire to rewrite history.   We need to learn from history, not bury it and pretend it did not happen.  We should not tear down monuments just because some people find them offensive.  Others would find it offensive to tear them down.  Are we now going to get into a battle of who is offended the most and the most offended will be able to use the power of government to impose its will on others?  If you want to add a plaque to a monument, explaining why some people find it offensive, that is fine, but leave it there so we can learn from it.

I also have no interest in attracting the vile Neo-Nazis and Antifas to our community.   Do you?  Do you want to encourage another Charlottesville disaster here?

We have a terrible crime problem in our community that is killing innocent children.  How about you focus on reducing crime instead of looking to stir up more trouble?
"
40204,"Re: Castleman statue
General Castleman, whatever his John Hunt Morgan involvement, was a Brigadier General in the U.S. Army. He was directly involved in the development of Tyler Park and indirectly in Cherokee Park. He was a bigger-than-life, irascible neighborhood figure. I vote for keeping the statue. It is our neighborhood history. Lincoln pardoned him, shouldn't we?"
40206,Change the narrative not the symbol. Change the plaque language to put it into context and leave the statues/monuments alone. 
40220,"While this is a very difficult issue - it is hardly a new one.  I think there is a benefit for having remembrances of the dark part of our history within view of the public. If we decide as a community that we do not wish to see or continue to reflect upon the history that we disagree with or that we find repugnant, how can we ever have a mature conversation about how we as a society have hopefully evolved.  Some say to move these structures to another place (i.e. Brandenburg) but I think it best to allow the controversies of the past to continue to inform us in the present and future.  If we desire to mature as a moral society, it is best not to do away with the remembrances of how far we have hopefully come.  Sometimes it is best to be able to say:  ""look at that statue - it represents just how difficult things use to be.  But we can be better now!""  It should be redemptive to see the past and know that we are striving to transform into a better society.  If the past is removed or tucked away from view, what will be our point of reference?  We must never endorse the evils of the past.  But to obscure or remove them from view, presents us with a very narrow vision."
40206,"I am against the removal of any of these statues.  This whole review is nothing more than trying to ""sanitize"" our history for the sake of political correctness, no different than ISIS destroying monuments.  There are major issues facing our city, yet the mayor and his incompetent administration would rather focus on statues and pander to the autistic screeching of a vocal liberal minority.  Anyone ""triggered"" by a man on horseback needs to grow up and stop acting like a victim.  They weren't slaves, their grandparents weren't slaves, stop acting like you are owed something because of an event 200 years ago."
40217,"I am absolutely dumbfounded that this sort of ""review"" would even be considered. Not all works of art are beautiful to all, not all works of art are tasteful to all, not all works of art are meant to enlighten or uplift; some are meant to provoke and be challenging and thought-provoking to the viewer. That is the beauty and also the conundrum of art, it is meant to be subjective. If it is not appealing, move along; no harm done, no one is forcing anyone to view art if they don't wish to, and public art tends to become part of the fabric of the city, something that is usually taken for granted unless someone brings it to the attention of the public for whatever reason. That is the beauty of living in a free society, the freedom to create art of one's choosing or to ignore it if it is not to one's taste. A horrible precedent was set in Germany in the 1930s when art was reviewed and considered deviant- absolutely no one wants this precedent to be repeated and this is exactly how it started. The terrible part is that young people today think that this is not only justifiable but morally necessary- blindly following without learning the truth behind the history and the art they are trying to destroy- and in doing so admitting that something as neutral and non-threatening as a statue would make them upset or make them resort to violence. I'm concerned that we are not only losing our ties to history, we are losing our freedoms, one at a time. The Confederate monument is already down, despite being protected under law. What did that change? Absolutely nothing. What's next? Statues of Abraham Lincoln? He was a slave owner. Change the name of the Speed Museum? He was a slave owner, too. Change the name of Jefferson County? He was a slave owner. How about Louisville? King Louis wasn't without fault, either. The point is that if the same standard is applied to Confederate monuments as it is to monuments to other historical figures they will almost certainly have to come down and we will all be poorer for it. I would like to think that in this day and age we are all adult enough to value our freedoms and to admit that we are mature enough not to be offended by public art just because someone without historical knowledge says we should be. Kindest Regards, Kim Land"
40205,"I think that specific CSA memorial monuments should be moved to museums in order to preserve history, but at the same time, not draw the public passerby into an offensive or uncomfortable position. However, I think that moving non CSA specific monuments, like Castleman, require a bit more consideration and debate. While I agree that those with a severe history of racial oppression should be moved, we must be careful not to get to the point where we are removing anything and everything with a slight tie to slavery, like historical homes with slave walls, or something of that sort. As long as we take the time to discuss as a community both sides of the coin before making any decisions, I believe the right choice would be made."
40205,"People can interpret things many ways, it will be very difficult to determine how people will interpret things and in any attempt pendulum can swing too far, one way or another.  I strongly support the elimination of clear and overt signs and symbols of the confederacy (flags, statues commemorating confederate Soldiers, paintings of Soldiers in confederate uniforms; streets, parks, and buildings named after confederate generals; school mascots like the Atherton rebels, and confederate flags on gravestones in Cave Hill cemetery on Memorial/Veterans day etc). 

Where I believe we may go too far are is the elimination of the depictions of Louisvilllians who may have been on the wrong side of morality during the war but were later pardoned. This may provide an opportunity to demonstrate and acknowledge the necessary reconciliation that took place after the civil war.  I do not interpret the Castleman statue as honoring bigotry, racism and/or slavery.  Just like a lot of people who fought for the confederacy in the civil war, and in a act of reconciliation by the government of the United States, he was pardoned.  As a retired Soldier and combat veteran myself, I know that nations must be able to reconcile with their enemies, otherwise we will end up in a perpetual state of war as those defeated have no recourse but to continue fighting.  Unfortunately some people have branded this as a confederate statue, right or wrong, and it will continue to be a flashpoint.  This is why the clarity you, the Commission on Public Art, can provide on what is and is not considered as art honoring bigotry, racism and/or slavery will be useful, maybe not satisfying to all, but useful as a start point (see above list of overt signs of the confederacy).

Racism, fascism, Nazism, and hate must once again be fought and defeated and I'm happy to be on the front lines but when's its over, we must find a way to reconcile, otherwise it's not over.  Elimination of those who we reconciled with is no way to do it.   
"
40242,"Mayor Fisher.  

I am appalled at how the local art and the symbols of US History have been desecrated and attacked by bullies hiding behind some sacred sheath of liberalism.  Their actions seem to be akin to historical situations of book burning - and frankly the fact that you are cowering to their bully tactics is very disappointing to me.....I took you as better than that.

I am not an extremist, I am not a racist but I will tell you that I am extremely disappointed that I will not be able to show my grandchildren the wonderful statues and explain to them the facts of their history and what people have done - good and bad - for reasons that need to be understood - not vilified.

The Civil war was about state rights, slavery was a part of that, but not all of it.  Cities and states are currently stating they have their rights - health care and sanctuary cities being two of them - what is the difference?  

In hind sight, like anything, vision is 20/20 - and I implore you to not have it so when hindsight is used 50 years from now that the cowering to the left hasn't left our city - and more importantly our country - in a worse place than it is today.

To know where to go, you have to know where you have been....not erase where you have been.

Intelligent people who review the facts and don't let the vocal minority sway them make the right decisions - please do so for the sake of the next generation of the silent majority.

Sincerely.

Robert Longshore"
40162,They are sore losers take down anything confederate!
40229,Please take down the confederate era statues. 
40217,I am strongly against censorship of any kind.  I believe removing art of any kind because some find it offensive is the first step down a slippery slope.  Instead of removing this art why not add new diverse artwork to our cities collection.
40213,"after you all get done removing the statues , then you can go into the schools and rip out the pages in the history books that cover the Civil War because apparently that is  not politically correct,  oh and don't forget to tell the re inactors that they can no longer participate in the Civil war as it never happened.  this is like when Hitler came to power and tried to wipe out anything having to do with Jewish people including the people themselves we are what we are warts and all no nation is perfect there is a wise statement once said if we ignore history we are bound to repeat it but no one seems smart enough to take good advice so much for our modern forward thinking all enclusive culture  when does the sanitaton stop!!!!!!!"
40207,"In 2017, Confederate Statues have no place in our city - not that they really ever have. If the city would like to keep the regal appeal of the statue, remove Cattleman and leave his horse. Better yet, why not replace it with a louisville hero? What about Muhammad Ali, or Alberta O. Jones? People who really made a difference for the community. "
40204,"Please do NOT remove the Castleman statue. I have lived near it for almost 30 years. I bought our house because of the neighborhood and the presence of a beautiful horse and gentleman that I would see every day. The Castleman statue is a well known landmark and mentioning it to others makes it easier for them to find my house, and possibly adds value to my property. 

I wonder if just the removal of the Castleman literature or verbiage would satisfy the others. 

I especially love to see the gentleman covered with snow in the winter when the artistic essence shines. 

Thanks for the opportunity to voice my opinion. "
42261,Please leave our History alone. I find it unconscionable that you would even think about taking down the statues and erasing our history. I VOTE TO NOT REMOVE any Statues nor Erase any of our HISTORY
40208,History is important so we dare not repeat it. History should also be taught in context and without glorification. The pieces of public art in Louisville that glorify history the history of slavery or historical actors of racism belong in a museum where they can be presented in context of the attrocities of that time. They do not belong in rural KY communities that want to erect them in their town squares so they can teach their community about how to glorify racism or slavers. 
,"Mr. Mayor, I am aware that times have changed, but trying to remove history be that it is sometimes upsetting doesn't  change the fact it happened. Removing  statues is a shame and a inslute to people and families who have given all for this country past, present and future. You make dissions everyday that is not popular with all people, does this mean you should leave office because of it? Vandalism  is a crime not an excuse to get what you want. There is so many muders and unsolved crimes that your time and a special groups time would be better served taking care of those thing. History is something you look at and say we don't  want to make these mistakes again. Stop teaching hate, discrimination and racist  behavior, all people not just certain groups. Thank you.  "
40204,"The monument commemorating John Castleman in the heart of Cherokee Triangle is historical and stirs feelings of pride in our neighborhood’s history. But although he did some good, the fact is that Castleman was far from being a great man.  Besides his Confederate past, he was disturbed that African Americans were playing tennis in the parks, and pushed for segregation.  Castleman was motivated mainly by self interest in his public service. His entire involvement with the park commission was trying to make money off his land, according to local historian Eric Burnette. He also was opposed to the hiring of Frederick Law Olmstead to design our great parks.

I asked a black friend to take a look at the monument and tell me what he felt.  I almost fell over when he said “First thing that comes to mind, he said, is an old rich white man on his high horse”.  That really hit me, because what he was saying is that the statute is an emblem of white superiority and white privilege.  

It’s time to evaluate whether the future of our Highlands neighborhoods should embrace such symbols. What kind of neighborhood do we want to be for the 21st century?  One that embraces a certain class of people, or that which welcomes diversity and all people of color from all walks of life? 

The ugliness of white supremacists demonstrations in Charlottesville is a clarion call to all neighborhoods and locales to take down symbols of our dark pasts. I call on our city to act to put this past behind us. Taking Castleman off his high horse is a start

"
40204,"I realize that the statue of General Castleman in the Cherokee Triangle has been debated recently but I feel that is only because it is misunderstood. It was built to honor his contributions to our city NOT his military service either in the civil war or the Spanish American war. 
There is no need to remove it. 
On the subject of other statues around town I have less of an opinion. Perhaps the city could commission works that would balance out our representation of diversity. "
40207,"Most of these statues have been in place for a hundred years or more.  I don't understand why now, do they offend people.  The Civil War is over, it was over a 100+ years ago, we need to put all the hate behind us.  Those statues where not erected based on racism.  They were erected because at the time there were people who served in that war who wanted to honor their leaders and their dead.  They have nothing to do with racism or the struggle between blacks and whites.  They are no different that any grave stone or marker.  We need to leave the past in the past, and concentrate on how we can live together in peace."
40299,"I am sick and tired of everything be done in this city and nation in the name of race!
The Civil War was not ONLY about slavery! It was brothers vs. brothers fighting for their beliefs. States rights. Government control etc.
To remove memorials is a disgrace to our ancestors.
As President Trump said yesterday. Are we going to remove all traces of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson? They were slave owners!
It was the way it was back then! Let it go!
Quit making everything Racial and maybe racism will subside!
Peace to all!
"
40242,"I'll leave my opinions about the current national discussion aside except for this one possible solution. I recommend we melt down the Castleman statue and mold it into a statute of him sitting on a park bench in order to convey his role in creating the Olmstead park system we all know and love today. The military aspect of his career should not be part of his legacy, due to its controversial aspect."
40299,"Why is it whenever something offends someone, we have to cave to them?  Our statues represent history-we can not change it.  If you don't like it, don't look at it.  If people would check their own history, chances are their own ancestors were involved with the same things that the statues represent. Leave them alone & lets keep history safe!!!"
40206,"Public art should include all of citizens, not exclude them by celebrating the subjugation of their ancestors. Historically, statues celebrating the Confederacy or Confederate service were erected during the era of Jim Crow to reinforce to African Americans that while they were not slaves they were second-class citizens. In Louisville John B. Castleman oversaw the segregation of local parks--years before providing a separate-but-(un)equal park for black Louisvillians. Whatever their complex subtexts, the impetus for erecting these monuments was to glorify the lost cause and remind the city that white supremacy was the natural order. 

When the University of Alabama erected a statue remembering the Confederacy, the keynote speaker clearly articulated the purpose of such monuments. ""The present generation, I am persuaded, scarcely takes note of what the Confederate soldier meant to the welfare of the Anglo Saxon race during the four years immediately succeeding the war, when [they] saved the very life of the Anglo Saxon race in the South."" ""I trust I may be pardoned for one allusion ... One hundred yards from where we stand, less than ninety days perhaps after my return from Appomattox, I horse-whipped a negro when until her skirts hung in shreds, because upon the streets of this quiet village she had publicly insulted and maligned a Southern lady, and then rushed for protection to these University buildings where was stationed a garrison of 100 Federal soldiers. I performed the pleasing duty in the immediate presence of the entire garrison."" ""That for which they battled in memory of this monument is reared, as well as for the survivors of that bloody drama, was not achieved. But the cause for which they fought is not lost, never can be, never will be lost while it is enshrined in the hearts of the people of the South.""

I would rejoin: so long as these monuments stand, the evil of slavery will never be cleansed from the hearts of Louisvillians.
"
40241,"Take down the salute with the dick on Main Street.


"
40220,"We need to keep the statues in place, this is how Hitler spread communism in the 30""s, everything was destroyed that didn't fit his outlook.  My opinion is if you don't like them, don't look at them.  They statues need to stay, we learn from our history, to erase, to censorship everything that bothers someone is opening pandoras box, where will it end; it will not have a good ending, it will be the demise of America"
40217,All public monuments to the Confederacy must be removed sooner rather than later. They are a constant reminder of slavery and celebrate traitors to our country. Put them in a museum if you must but they deserve no place in our public space. 
40220,"In June I had the great pleasure to visit Berlin, Germany. We had an excellent tour guide, a German native who was the son of a U.S. soldier who had been stationed there in the 1960s. During his time with our group, our guide spoke extensively about the horrors committed by the Nazi regime. He pointed out areas where the Third Reich had built headquarters and had planned the atrocities of the Holocaust. In those areas now stand museums and memorials to the victims of those atrocities. There are no memorials to the Nazis. There are not statues or signs or symbols honoring their bravery or even just their ""service."" But Berlin, and Germany as a whole, have not forgotten their past. They try to reconcile with it every single day, and to redeem themselves through humble and honest atonement. We should follow their lead. Tear down any and all statues honoring the Confederacy, their soldiers and officers, or their atrocities. Move them to museums if you must, but get them down without further delay. It is time for us to reconcile and atone. "
40205,"If, as many opponents of removing images of Confederate leaders claim, this issue is about history and learning, then make it so. Rather than remove statues, a suitable compromise would be to begin a program of melting them down and re-casting them as other Civil War figures. Slaves breaking free of their chains, abolitionists, Underground Railroad leaders, even ordinary soldiers on both sides who died due to the intransigent racism of Confederate leaders. If it is truly about history and learning, rather than about honoring leaders who led millions to their deaths over their right to own human beings, there will be no opposition. Sadly, I suspect it is about something much darker - reverence for those leaders. But this suggestion would prove it so. Then just remove them."
40207,Please stop the madness. You can not erase our nations history because of political correctness. The ones that are calling for the removal of statues are  acting just like ISIS when they destroy ancient sites. Where and when does it stop?
,"   The truth is, prior to current events, if you asked random Louisvillians passing by who these monuments depicted, I'd wager 9 out of 10 couldn't answer correctly without reading the signs posted. They do not depict slavery or racism, they depict local historical figures. Although people pass them every day, today's young people just see a man on a horse and could in no way rightfully feel offended. Last week you could’ve asked where the statue of John B. Castleman is located, then asked them where the man on the horse is in The Highlands and saw which you would’ve received a correct answer to. 
   How our citizens view these monuments today may influence what public art is created in the future, but these monuments had the support of the city at the time they were erected and therefor are a part of our history. They reflect the views of our community at the time, and we should certainly consider reflecting on the views of our current community for future generations to compare. That will only illustrate how we have grown to become better human beings. ""Those who do not know their history..."" 

   If the City would now like to commemorate historical (or current) figures that It believes in retrospect stood for Its current beliefs, I would fully support and encourage creating new monuments to preserve their role in our history. Just as we did not replace statues of Washington as new leaders and views emerged, we should honor these historical figures with the same respect and use the negative side of their stories to better teach our younger generations.
   Recently, it has been brought to the Nation's attention that only men are depicted on major pieces of US currency. No one suggested we remove all men from the face of bills because they were sexist. Why would we remove these monuments? I would make a safe bet that virtually all of our nation's leaders and pioneers of the period owned slaves, with many fighting to secure their ability to do so. Washington owned slaves. Daniel Boone owned slaves. Henry Clay freed his slaves, but not until the time of his death, in his will. Lewis and Clark owned slaves of which York is also memorialized in our city. Are we to destroy their history as well? The Nazis did this in Germany. Isis did it in Syria. Americans should rise above such irresponsible behavior. Despite their faults, these men made our country what it is today.
   The men memorialized were not simply soldiers of the Confederate Army. John B. Castleman for example, is a big part of our city's history. That history is not just of a Confederate soldier, but a soldier of the US Army, an anti-corruptionist and a man that believed in and helped create the public park system our city enjoys and boasts today. He is honored and depicted as a civilian in civilian clothing as a beloved member of his community, not as a racist. 
   None of these monuments honor racism. I have yet to see a plaque that says we honor this person because of their hatred. They honor those who fought for not only their beliefs, but the beliefs of those in their community. These men contributed more to the community than simply fighting on the side they believed to be in their best interest and deserve to have their stories preserved, both good and bad. Even the now removed statue from the U of L site did not simply honor the Confederate Army, but the individual men who gave their lives. None of these monuments depict negativity, they do not speak ill of another. They simply commemorate someone that our city believed stood up for the rest of the community of the time. They speak positive of particular figures and address no one negatively.
  We now understand that the world isn't flat and all men are created equal. Everyone has positive and negative history. Future generations have so much to learn from both. I am also not perfect, and I hope my children can follow the lead of my good decisions, and learn to avoid making the same mistakes I have made. Pretending as if I have made no mistakes is simply foolish, and advances us none as a society. 
  We have advanced as a human race despite and because of our history. I personally know no one who was either a slave or has owned slaves. Americans are treated more equally today than during any time in our nation's history. We are not perfect, but we are advancing, we are improving, we are learning to communicate with one another and find our similarities, and less and less over time do we assume our differences. Behind more and more media reports of hatred, are Americans who feel no hate in their hearts and are watching along next to someone of a different background. 
   We are growing even while the statue of John Castleman stands. Removing these monuments only creates a new fight that will further divide us. Let us use our tax dollars to continue writing our history, not attempt to delete the parts we aren’t proud of. A history that shows our growth towards a better, stronger, more compassionate community. Let us honor all of those who risked or gave their lives for what they believed at the time was for the best of their entire community, both of the Union and those of the Confederacy. Both are part of the history of Louisville. Let us celebrate us all. Let us celebrate our growth, not attempt to erase how we got here.

40206,"Statues are erected to honor and glorify members of society. The Lincoln memorial, recently defaced, the Washington Monument, memorials to fallen veterans and victims of war--most notably the Holocaust Memorial, also recently vandalized. These examples honor victims and those who ""fought for their country"", whatever the motivation of said country's leaders.

Statues erected by private citizens during times of conflict which glorify and honor evil people who worked against a just, free society and against citizens--up to and including their implicit and explicit involvement in violence, injustice, and suppression of rights--have no place in any city in these United States.

Likewise, statues erected by leaders to glorify themselves are tyrannical and an insult to the people who fund them. Public spaces and public art are for the benefit of every citizen, and should NOT insult or insinuate a deficit of their humanity, citizenship, or rights.

I would further like to state, since the topic is directly related, that the police are public servants meant to PROTECT citizens. They should likewise not be tools of intimidation, violence or political will against the people. Protestors in solidarity with the terrorized citizens of Charlotte were met with police intimidation for their peaceful acts this past weekend, and although I appreciate a review of LMPD policy as ordered by Mayor Fischer, it is paramount to the free society and peaceful, diverse city we all love to investigate the officers who used the physical force of vehicles against protestors. It shows the same deficit of respect that those statues show for an officer to assault, to whatever degree, a private citizens with their vehicle. This is amplified by the context of vehicular murder carried out in the name of white supremacy terrorism in Charlottesville. Mayor Fischer's unequivocal stand against hate speech and white supremacy on CBS must now be reflected in the actions he takes and orders to those he leads.

I'm glad there is a commission reviewing this. I'm glad that commission is taking public comment. I believe in conversation and transparent democracy. I also believe the rights of individuals to safety, respect and equal treatment under law are of the highest importance. I name Mayor Fischer because he ultimately has the authority to remove these symbols of hate, whatever the results of this open comment period, and if he is truly committed to standing against hate and injustice, to shaping a city where everyone has opportunity regardless of zip code, he will have to step up here and now in this symbolic battle."

40218,"Eliminating historical places, objects, art work, etc... does not change history. Rather than to soften the blow of the reality that happened in the past, people need to accept history for what it is, learn why and what happened and the see the significant changes that have happened since then. Removing items that hurt someone's feeling will never work because you cannot make everyone happy. Some historical figures may have held views that most no longer agree with, but their contributions to the society cannot go unnoticed. People need to grow up and accept the way things were, learn from the past and use the ""offensive"" artwork as a tool for teaching and learning.  "
40215,"I'm torn. Honoring Confederate Generals as heroes with a statue or whatever, when they fought and wanted to destroy the United States and also supporting slavery, I think isn't right. But on the other hand the statue that was removed on 2nd St. which was a memorial of Confederate soldiers that died in the Civil War I think should've not been removed. The Civil War was the most heart wrenching war the US has ever fought. Our Union Soldiers died and killed their own brothers, Fathers, and cousins in the fight against slavery. I would think even a Union Soldier at one time would want a memorial for his Confederate relatives. 
Now, how far tearing down monuments and statues will this go? Like I heard recently, Thomas Jefferson and George Washington had slaves. Of course at that time, every country had slaves of some form. But we have got to remember that the US fought against slavery in the Civil War. Remember that Washington and Jefferson is the Fathers of the US. 
The worst shame that a America has is how white America treated African Americans after the Civil War.  
I look at the statue of Lincoln and Davis in Frankfort. We can use these people as an example for what our government is about. Two complete different sides. I'm thankful that the one side lost. The other won to make a more perfect Union. It's the same if you stop to think of it when it comes to the Democratic process of Republican and Democrat. One wins and the other loses hopefully to make a more perfect Union. The US has been divided before. The US will survive as we always have as a country.
 Another thing. I'd like to see more statues of Union generals and soldiers. Thank you for hearing what I got To say. James   "

40204,"I have no attachment to this statue.  I don't see its removal as rewriting history nor do I see leaving it in place as endorsing slavery or racism. 
 I believe a prominently displayed explanation of the statue, both historical and current, would be beneficial.  Furthermore, I suggest that comparable statues depicting leaders of rebellion and resistance to slavery and racism be erected in close proximity to any ""pieces that can be interpreted to be honoring bigotry, racism and/or slavery.""

I know Castleman served in the Confederate Army as a young man and then in the the U.S. Army, where he served in the Spanish-American War and was eventually a brigadier general. I have never thought of the statue as a Confederate memorial. My impression is the statue was erected as a tribute to Castleman's service as Commissioner of the Board of Parks, where he helped to establish Louisville's Olmsted Park System. Hence the location on Cherokee Parkway, looking toward the entrance of Cherokee Park.  He is not depicted in military dress, but in equestrian clothes, which also led me to believe the recognition had nothing to do with his military career. Perhaps the historical marker should be revised to better reflect this."

Racism and white supremacy have no place in our community, but the John Breckinridge Castleman monument represents neither.

Please note that Castleman, the founder of the American Saddlebred Association, sits atop his favorite mare, Carolina in civilian clothes and unarmed.

Here is a LINK of all the civil war monuments in the state for comparison: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_American_Civil_War_monuments_in_Kentucky

Out of all the monuments there are only two ""confederate officers"" depicted. The John Hunt Morgan memorial went up first in 1911, two years before Castleman, and paid for The Daughters of the Confederacy. Note his confederate uniform and his holstered pistol.

40215,When did art become subjected to approval of the masses -- 
40204,"My remarks are adapted from a speech by Mitch Landrieu, the mayor of New Orleans after that city wisely and justly removed confederate monuments. 

There is a difference between remembrance of history and reverence of it.

Let’s start with the facts.

The historic record is clear, confederate statues were not erected just to honor men and battles and deeds, but as part of the movement which became known as The Cult of the Lost Cause. This ‘cult’ had one goal — through monuments and through other means — to rewrite history to hide the truth, which is that the confederacy was on the wrong side of humanity. These monuments were meant to rebrand the history and defeated ideals of a defeated confederacy. It is self-evident that these men did not fight for the United States of America, They fought against it. They may have been warriors, but in this cause they were not patriots. These statues are not just stone and metal. They are not just innocent remembrances of a benign history. These monuments purposefully celebrate a fictional, sanitized confederacy; ignoring the death, ignoring the enslavement, and the terror that it actually stood for.

After the Civil War, confederate statues were a part of that terrorism as much as a burning cross on someone’s lawn; they were erected purposefully to send a strong message to all who walked in their shadows about who was still in charge. Should you have further doubt about the true goals of the confederacy, in the very weeks before the war broke out, the Vice President of the Confederacy, Alexander Stephens, made it clear that the confederate cause was about maintaining slavery and white supremacy. He said in his now famous ‘cornerstone speech’ that the confederacy’s 

“cornerstone rests upon the great truth, that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery — subordination to the superior race — is his natural and normal condition. This, our new government, is the first, in the history of the world, based upon this great physical, philosophical, and moral truth.”

Now, with those shocking words still ringing in your ears, I want to try to gently peel from your hands the grip on a false narrative of our history that I think weakens us. And make straight a wrong turn we made many years ago — we can more closely connect with integrity to the founding principles of our nation and forge a clearer and straighter path toward a better city and a more perfect union."
40207,"Confederate statues, or statues of Confederates, are not the values our Compassionate City represents and honors.  There is no argument in which the pros of maintaining them outweigh the cons.  They must all be removed, at once, and without notice.  Baltimore did it right.  Lexington has invited disaster."
40219,"Removing pieces of history regarding the Civil War is removing the fact that the United States is the only country that officially banned slavery country-wide.  I believe it is best that we remember that our country fought and died to end it here.  Also, it is best to focus on the good things John Breckinridge Castleman did later in life."
40241,"I feel very torn about the removal of Confederate statue s.  I do not deny the dark days of our past but removing reminders do not change the past.  Perhaps an additional plaque at these locations describing the total life of the individual.  As human beings perhaps some of these individuals may have redeemed themselves.  

As a lover of history and genealogy,  I have learned to take an open approach to these things with no judgement but let the facts speak for themselves.  History is history and symbols should remind us of a darkness we do not wish to repeat rather than eradicate it from our minds.  If these symbols must be removed, take them to a confederate cemetery and reinstall them there.  If we don't keep the history alive in our memories I feel we are in danger of repeating these atrocities. 
"
40229,Tearing down these statues or things depicting the civil war fixes nothing.  It is apart of US history.  If anything it shows that at one time we were divided and in the end we came together.   When those statues were built and place I'm sure slavery was a more sensitive and fresh subject. Yet they were placed.  Now people many generations removed from slavery or the black rights movement for that matter want to cry foul.  I'm of Irish decent and you don't hear me ccrying that my ancestors were slaves too.  Maybe we should take down my ancestors statues too.  I'm sure Daniel and squire Boone are touchy subjects with native Americans.   They could say that about any thing dealing with American history so do we meet their demands too.  Its history learn from it embrace that we saw the errors in our ways and fought to get to where we are.  Stop dwelling on the past.  Keep them right where they are protect them for future generations not hide them.  
40205,"Please do NOT remove our monuments, especially General Castleman.   I grew up on Cherokee road in the shadow of General Castleman. Monuments such as Castleman piqued my interested in learning about history, the good and the bad.  I don't know of anyone who considered Castleman a CSA statue. Most people didn't know the history at all. A century he has stood, always a positive landmark.   Now suddenly he's offensive?    Castleman has always meant something positive to me, a beautiful statue that is an emblem of the Highlands and of the Cherokee Triangle association, the entrance to Cherokee parkway and Cherokee Park. I've enjoyed hours nearby at the foot of the statue enjoying the Cherokee Art fair.  I've been proud to entertain guests on Bardstown road and in the Highlands showing off our unique and beautiful area and General Castleman has always played a big part in that.   Thank you.    "
45014,"Please leave the confederate statues alone. It is part of history and the people they represent did great things.  If you take those monuments down then take Martin Luther King, Rosa Parks and others who may be offensive to people.
Thank you for your time."
40204,"How about a statue to Andrew Cowan to replace the current Castleman's statue? After all, he is the one we should thank for the existence of Cherokee park and not Castleman. Besides, just the fact that Caltleman fought to preserve slavery should disqualify him for being honored. 
Thank you. 
"
40215,"My personal opinion is that all statues should be left where they are. They are part of history, whether we agree or disagree. If we take them all down because someone is offended by them,it still happened,you cannot erase what happened. What will the children learn in school? Or are we going to pretend that none of it happened?if you take away everything that happened with black people,then we need to stop all things they are doing now. For example, the 100 man march, Martin Luther King Day. The white children have to go to school on Lincoln's birthday. What is the difference? Derby crusing on Broadway. Block parties where it messes up all the traffic, white folks don't shut down streets for parties. Should I be yelling discrimination? If we take away everything that offends everyone, what is left? If we are taking away everything that offend others, I need the Muhammad Ali center to close! I am white and feel out of place there, so does that make it racist? No, sounds silly right? Well a statue is just a piece of metal, not hurting anyone? We are regressing, not progressing! Not really sure when the United States of America became so tender. No one alive is effected by history, none of us were alive then, so why can't the past stay in the past. I believe it's time to move on and love our neighbors like God would want us too. Color should not have a part in whether you like someone or not. Time to grow up people, stop having tantrums like preschool children. Children learn what they live, and I for one don't like what you are teaching them. Thank you for letting me rant on this ridiculous situation."
40204,"How neighborhood is identified by the Castleman Statue. He was instrumental in the betterment of Louisville, and he was one Teddy Roosevelt's Rough Riders. He was a real hero!

We are proud of this statue and the person it represents. Many men fought in the Civil War and had slaves before it was illegal. We must look beyond the wishes of an out of control minority who want to take down a sense of pride we have in our neighborhood. 

I have lived in my house, having brought it back to life from and abandoned building, for 40 years. This neighborhood used to be full of boarding rooms, drugs, drunks, and vagrants. We have worked very hard to bring it back to a livable place again.

The Triangle residents just collected money to have the statue refurbished only two years ago. Mr. Castleman was not a well known person like Robert E. Lee or Jefferson Davis, so his removal would do little to satisfy their anger. These people need to move on to a statue of a person of more recognizable significance to stage their protest. Leave us alone! We are hard working, tax-paying citizens and don't want to be used to calm the anger of an out of control crowd! 

"
40242,"There is no place for Confederate Monuments in this city or in any other.  There are appropriate places for them...Cave Hill, museums, maybe even battlefields.  However, in public, they are too easily seen as celebrating the achievements of people trying to maintain slavery.  Castleman was a Confederate, was pro-slavery, was at one point exiled from the United States, and actively sought segregation throughout his life.  No matter what his achievements were post Civil War, he was always a racist.  Anywhere there are monuments celebrating the Confederacy, there are undoubtedly more appropriate subjects to memorialize.  Civil Rights Leaders, Women's Movement Leaders, or any other historical figure or event are more appropriate than Confederate Monuments.  Take them all down and replace them."
40204,"Myself and my family, who have lived in the highlands since the 1920's, are against having the statue removed."
42718,"I was so disappointed, angry with those who began removing our statues representing people from our history. 
What ever state it is, these pieces of art are a reminder of the people who shaped our country, gave their lives for our country. Removing them while trying to rewrite our country's history is so wrong.  We must teach history to our children, true history"
40299,"I am a Local artist with Sculptures worldwide and its been frustrating for me to try to get some public art in my own town. Its not without effort on our part. We even had a meeting with waterfront corporation to donate a sculpture and have it funded by corporations that they passed on. I am a abstract contemporary artist and my sculptures can be interpreted  in many ways by the viewer, but they are not history related or political. Its a shame i am known worldwide for my work and yet can not get my sculptures placed in my own city. Our public art program lacks far behind other cities when it comes to placing public art. I have never seen a open call for public art in our city and that is limited to only local artist. This happens in other cities all the time.
You may view my sculptures at our over 500 page website here www.ViscardiDesigns.com  Someone please help us get some well deserved sculptures in my hometown. If you have ever been to UofL's campus, Ky Derby museum, Ky Derby festival main head quarters,numerous suites at papa johns cardinal stadium and the yum center, chances are you have seen my Works of Art. We need more abstract Public art in our city. I am here Louisville. Tony Viscardi"
40205,"The Castleman statue needs to go. He was not only a traitor, but also a Jim Crow styled segregationist, and profiteered by his parks work. Surely there are dozens of better citizens, more worthy of such an honor. Not one additional dime should be spent to allow those who glory in the Lost Cause to continue to fight their battles in the public arena. 

Again, I repeat, Castleman has to go. Put his statue in a museum, that's great. But he doesn't have the right to colonize our public spaces any longer.

Best,
David Serchuk"
40205,"As a constituent of Metro Council District 8 and Louisville Metro, and as someone who has done a lot of research on Louisville's park system, I support removing the Castleman statue and replacing it with one of Andrew Cowan-- the real father of our Olmsted Park system. Castleman was a Confederate officer (which makes him a traitor to our country an a defender of slavery), a Confederate spy, and more importantly he presided over the segregation of the parks amid a climate of rising bigotry and intolerance. Beyond that, his principal interest in serving on the Park Commission was to make money for himself. He is not the kind of person we should celebrate in our public art. "
40299,"White supremacists incited deadly violence in Charlottesville, Virginia last week in defense of a Confederate monument. We must show the country that Louisville is no safe harbor to such hatred. We must remove the John B. Castleman monument at Cherokee Triangle. 

Confederate symbols on public land, in effect, endorse a movement founded on white supremacy. If our government continues to pay homage to the Confederacy, people of color can never be sure they will be treated fairly and we will never solve our community’s problems if an entire group of citizens is alienated or feels targeted for discrimination.

Confederate symbols belong in museums and on private property. In museums, we can learn their full history. Citizens will always have the right to fly the Confederate flag. They can still erect monuments on their own property. That will not change.

But it is past time to move our monument to an appropriate place. We should research how to remove the monument. Then we should act.

Sincerely,

Christina N. Howard

40245,"As a lifelong resident of Louisville, I know our city's and our people's values. Louisville's values do not align with those on display through the confederate statues around Louisville. These statues should be removed and sold or donated to history museums. They should not be in public open spaces or near any government building."
40229,If you take down the confederate pieces I also expect the city take down or rename anything to do with Martin Luther King & Muhammed Ali.  Martin Luther was anti gay & Muhammed Ali is a slap in the face to every veteran out there.  
40205,"I support the removal of the Castleman statue from the Cherokee Triangle neighborhood. In addition I support a city-wide effort to take a full inventory of public art and to think about how public art and design can better move the city toward healing, compassion, and inclusion. Thank you."
40204,"When reviewing public art that depicts persons connected with the Confederacy, I think it is important to consider why the monument was erected and what the person is being lauded for.  It seems clear to me that statues of Robert E Lee, Jefferson Davis  and other well known CSA figures, erected after reconstruction, were erected to venerate the CSA and maintain white supremacy.  Those statues should be removed from all public land. It is not appropriate that Louisville should celebrate the CSA thru such displays.

I don't think that statues erected to honor a person for accomplishments completely unconnected to the CSA should be removed solely because the person depicted was once a little known CSA soldier.  It is important to consider the intent of those placing the monument and what the person depicted is remembered for.  In our neghborhood, the Cherokee Triangle,  we have a statue of a man in civilian clothing riding a horse.  This man was a major in the CSA, but is not remembered for that.  He later became a general in the US Army, though that isn't why we have a statue of him either.  He is remembered as a champion and founder of the park system.   We have never thought of the statue as controversial, but lately, it has become so.

I realize that this issue is very emotional and that it can be hard for our community to discuss the nuances of particular art pieces.  But, I hope as people become aware of the history of the statue and Castleman's contribution to civic life in Louisville, they will realize the statue is not, in any way, a CSA memorial, but rather a park memorial."
40071,It ceased to be about the monuments after Charlottesville. The ideology they represent is enough for me to have them moved...not destroyed.  If the Neo Nazis and the white nationalists feel that strongly about the statues then raise the money to open a museum dedicated to the Confederacy.  That portion of our history should be remembered not honored.
40219,LEAVE THE STATUES (ART) ALONE!  It's not right that a few people who just want their 5 seconds of fame on TV can push their views on others. This is America for crying out loud!  What is wrong with people!  You don't like!!  Don't look at it!   
40203,"These statues are not an education in history. They, instead, broadcast a public endorsement of the conferacy's policies, ideals, etc., and you need to look. O further than the foul creatures that defend their display."
40207,"Perhaps the Commission should educate people about the reasons these statues were built.  I do not believe any statues in Louisville were put up to honor and reinforce bigotry, racism and/or slavery.  Please do not allow your public to be ignorant and falsely interpret our history as bigotry.  Please do not jump on this bandwagon."
40026,"I go along with what  Condoleezza Rice said,  "" When you start wiping out your history-sanitizing your history- to make you feel better, it's a bad thing!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
40213,"How about a little tit for tat? How can you even consider removing OUR Confederate statues? How in the hell can these statues remind people of a slavery that they, and for many, even their ancesters, never experienced. We cannot change history and must simply go forward. Do you suppose that in 100 years from now ancestors of those of us who are enslaved in the work force today will sue someone or erase history crying 'injustice'?   
  Also, these statues are old and therefore, established; when is someone going to object to the 'Slave Hands' in the Speed museum? That is new and if any art should be removed, it should. It is only there to dredge up hard feelings. Tell me THAT does not symbolize slavery and widen the racial abyss. Hey, many, if not most of the chanters for 'removal' were not even aware of the significance of OUR statues until certain groups wanted to incite trouble.  "
,Please remove all the statues and art that glorify a time that is an ugly black mark in our history.
40205,"These statues are a relic of a past that was an integral part of the foundation of racism and all its effects today. They are symbols that belong in a museum where the next generations study how forces past have employed race as a divider of the working class and served to dehumanize people in material and cultural ways. 

This city has much prouder legacies to celebrate and it is these that monuments should be built to, rather than those that to many of our siblings are legitimately symbols of oppression."
40245,"I understand that people have strong opinions regarding statues that currently reside in numerous areas around Louisville.  I also feel very strongly that just because you are offended doesn't mean you are right!!!!!   I truly feel that we have many many larger issues in Louisville at this time that need genuine intervention and public discussion!   These include the daily shooting of black on black youth in the West end !   DO theseBLACK LIVES NOT MATTER????  We have an epic drug epidemic in the city and all we continue to do is offer needle exchanges!  We have now decided that we need a MALES OF COLOR ACADEMY in Louisville to address African American history and culture.   Would it not be better to educate all children in their neighborhood schools to address the strengths and weaknesses within those neighborhoods and allow greater involvement of parents within these schools and students in extracurricular activities?  Is busing still really the answer?  Who does spending anywhere from 1 to 3 hours daily on a bus serve?  I think it makes the politicians feel better but does not help the students or the families in Jefferson county. I truly feel that as a community we have several huge issues that need more attention and resources.  Again, I am offended by all of the attention given to less significant issues in Louisville but that doesn't mean I am right!

40216,Leave the statues where they are.   It is our history
40208,"These monuments, along with the dozens around the country, normalize and deify white supremacy. In leaving these statues up and on a literal pedestal, we are remaining complacent in the systematic racism that has been controlled our country's narrative since its creation. TAKE DOWN THE STATUES.  "
40023,Leave history alone.  Don't give in to black lives matter. That was a hoax. Don't let the left tear down our history.  Mr mayor you give in to them you don't report crime in certain areas. So I am sure this a sham.  You will bow down to the left 
40204,"Please remove all statues celebrating the lives of people who fought for slavery or who contributed to the genocide of Native Americans. Kentuckians and Louisvillians have plenty of people to celebrate who fought against owning other humans, fought against the removal and mass death of Native Americans, fought against hate and bigotry. Lets erect statues of people we aspire to be like. Not to mention, we have very few statues of historical WOMEN. There are many Kentucky women of all colors who we should honor and celebrate. Our parks are named after the Native American tribes whose land we stole and continue to occupy. Let's at least honor them by not glorifying individuals who fought for white supremacy."
40223,"NO!  DO NOT REMOVE THE STATUE!  History is history, good and bad.  Learn from it, and don't repeat the mistakes.  Make it better by being educated about your past, NOT by destroying it and pretending it never existed.  Seems like this type of juvenile, behavior has been tried before by the Nazis, Taliban, etc.  RIDICULOUS!  GET A REAL LIFE PEOPLE AND GROWUP AND STOP THESE TEMPER TANTRUMS!  The media should stop throwing gas on the fire also!  "
47150,"I personally feel that statues honoring Confederate figures, either specific individuals or general memorials(common soldiers, etc.), in public places should NOT be removed due to their value both as art and historical objects. However, I understand and respect the views of those who find such statues offensive, and ultimately would not object to moving them provided they are preserved and displayed in a more appropriate setting. BUT - removing statues of individuals simply because they once served in the Confederacy, such as the Castleman statue, sets a VERY dangerous precedent! The Castleman statue IS NOT A CONFEDERATE MONUMENT!!! The statue in Cherokee Triangle honors Castleman's contributions to the Louisville park system in general and the Cherokee Triangle area in particular, NOT his former service as a Confederate officer. LONG AFTER the Civil War, Castleman retired honorably from the UNITED STATES ARMY as a brigadier general, and became a prominent philanthropist. So, in a very real sense, the Castleman statue is a UNITED STATES ARMY VETERAN'S MEMORIAL.

Consider where this could lead... Picture THESE lines in a future news story: ""CITY REMOVES LOUISVILLE PHILANTHROPIST AND ARMY VETERAN'S MEMORIAL WHILE A STATUE HONORING A RACIST, WHITE SUPREMACIST, KNOWN HUMAN TRAFFICKER, AND SEXUAL ABUSER OF A WOMAN HE HELD IN BONDAGE REMAINS ON PROMINENT DISPLAY IN COURTHOUSE SQUARE"". I am referring, of course, to old TJ himself, Thomas Jefferson, who bought and sold slaves and fathered children with at least one of them. Coming soon after, no doubt, a movement to rename Jefferson County... 

Bottom line - Leave Castleman where he is. Remove him and you may well open a floodgate... "
40214,"I hate the thought of having any art associated with racism or any other bigotry. As an African-American, it is an insult."

40204,The Castleman statue has long been the gateway to both the Cherokee Triangle and Olmstead's Cherokee Park. He was a civic leader and public philanthropist. His work as a civilian in the post Civil War period was exemplary. It would be an absurd  reaction to thoughtless revisionist history to tamper with this memorial to his good works. Abraham Lincoln would- I am sure- echo this sentiment. Many Confederate leaders went on to contribute to the United States post Civil War.
40204,"Gen. Castleman was a supporter of the Olmsted city parks. As such, he was a civilian contributor to the creation of our much beloved Cherokee Park. His statue commemorates his efforts to create open spaces, open to all citizens. His is a monument dedicated to generous civic activism. "
40204,"some thoughts on the castleman statue:
-i'm of the understanding that this statue is not so much a ""confederate memorial"" as it is a memorial to someone who, among other things in his life, served in the confederacy. i'm not sure if that's an important distinction. i'm inclined to think that america and its cities shouldn't honor anyone who fought for or supported the confederacy. 
-i do think there's a difference between a statue of, say, robert e lee or stonewall jackson, men who are known to history b/c of their role in the confederacy, and someone like castleman, who is largely insignificant to american history and was not particularly important to the war.
-i think the signage around the statue is shameful, as it seems to deliberately neglect castleman's place in the war -- it mentions he fought, but only alludes to his role in the confederacy. this doesn't strike me as accidental. at the very least, the signage should be improved.
-personally, i'd like to see an intelligent, respectful conversation about what kind of place a monument like this has in our city. i'm not, at least not at the moment, of the mindset that we should tear it down -- though i do think an honest conversation and look into its history, could lead us to that conclusion.
-on a personal level, i'm by no means an expert, have no in-depth knowledge of history. it's just a statue i pass every day on the way to work and walk past on the weekends to get my coffee. it's a beautiful statue, aesthetically, but it celebrates a person with a complicated, very probably repugnant, history.

thank you!"
40219,Those statues honor racism and slavery and led the heart of the  Charlottesville March. They must be removed. 
40223,"Hi Mayor,

      I'm not in favor of removing statues because there will be no stopping of the madness.  After all the statues are removed.  Then people will check their pockets and be offended by the faces on the coins and bills.  Then street signs bridges, airports and even the name for the state of Washington will come into question.  Please stop the madness....please let history remain as a reminder to not repeat the past.  Purges never turn out to be the solution for anything.

Regards,

Mike D."
40229,"We have public art commemorating our whites and their successes, don't we? Why shouldn't we have public art commemorating bigotry, racism, and slavery. "
40056,"These statues don't glorify the slave trade of this country's past they do however honor men who made differences all over this country.
Castleman's statue in Cherokee Circle was not about him owning slaves, this man served in the US Army and donated land to our wonderful park.
He isn't even wearing a confederate uniform on the statue.
Why let all these dishonorable people take away from the memory of honorable historic citizens."
40216,I think all the statues should remain. THey are a part of our history.
47432,"I have been watching the destruction and moving/hiding of the Civil War Statues in not only Louisville, but many other cities across the country.  I am frankly ashamed and embarrassed at this because I thought that an educated country would never stoop the this kind of low.  This is not a new policy however, because this is one of the first things that Adolph Hitler did to control Germany.  The key word there is control.  I wonder how many people are aware that after the Civil War, both the south and the north were termed only as Americans.  I keep hearing that the Civil War was fought for the issue of slavery, but this is completely wrong.  Slavery was one small part of the war, but the Civil War was fought for States Rights, and this fact is historically correct.  I wonder if this is why we actually have 48 States and two Commonwealths?  Why do these two resist Statehood, or is this some sort of rebellion?  I wonder why this is suddenly a problem at all.  These statues have been there for decades without any issues like this, and suddenly they are a problem?  If we want to get rid of a statue that should be a complete embarrassment, it would be that of US Grant.  He was little more than a drunkard, but just happened to be on the winning side.  Maybe they should hang a sign on his saying ""here is the winning drunkard of the Civil War.""  I realize that my comments are not welcome to the liberals in our society, but so be it.  I have the same right to freedom of speech that they do  I think the root of the problem is that this country has turned it's back on GOD and morality.  I have to watch almost daily on many news stations, issues like the LGBT movement and the honoring of draft dodgers in this country, This kind of thing makes me sick, and then I have to watch what I term as illiterate people taking down history.  I would appeal to anyone that is educated in HISTORY to leave these alone, and they are HISTORY and nothing else.  I am very proud to be an American and nothing will ever change this.  There are three flags that I will fly in this order.  The American Flag, the Confederate Flag, and the flag of Israel.  All three of these have suffered and seem to be still suffering at the hands of ignorant people.  Leave the Civil War statues and art alone."
40202,LEAVE the ART alone you can't change history how would the mayor fill when he is no longer mayor that his name is just rerased Iike he was never here
40217,"Create a fund to erect statues to people we should be honoring. (And please, Statues, not abstract)"
40204,"While I do not approve of extreme people on the right or left or any acts of violence or mistreatment of  fellow man, I am  sad that historic monuments are being moved ,maybe even destroyed.They are pieces of art and witnesses to our history , good or bad. Today most art is unskilled and not well made. It would cost a fortune of reproduce a piece like the Castleman statue. The statue is a landmark in this area and adds to the beauty of the neighborhood. Removing it to me is like destroying a beautiful historic building or burning books. I am an immigrant from Europe .Napoleon was a terrible man but if everything related to him would be taken down, France would lose so much beauty and heritage. The same goes for all their kings and their castles. Should Versailles be torn down??Germany would have to take down all monuments referring to the war of 1870 or WW! and considering what cruel enslavers the Romans were , most of the statues of the Roman empire should be taken down and destroyed as well. How about all statues of Henry the 8th?? Where do you stop?? What insanity to go after these statues. What""s next? Pretty soon we have to be careful what we say. If it is offensive we might be fined or jailed in the future. Who is demanding all this? Removing these confederate monuments will put violent ideas and excuses for violence into unstable peoples minds. People on the right and left ( alt right versus anarchists for example) are just waiting to cause problems. We should let this rest and not bring attention to it, People who demand it should have better things to do to actually improve this country and stop the divisions. Only our enemies  abroad profit from our divided country.It always strikes me how much Americans hate their own country. I think I am going to hang out my flag permanently. That would be really offensive to a lot of people. "
40229,"This is my second comment, I apologize. I misunderstood what it was asking the first time. I am for the removal of these statues because it is not okay that there are other statues honoring whites and their accomplishments, yet we have statues of blacks being beaten... that's not acceptable. We are in 2017, there is no room in our country for bigotry, racism, slavery, fighting, any of it. We need to focus on our ties with others and stop fighting within ourselves. This is what destroyed us during the civil war, WW1, and WW2. Are you really ready to let it happen again? "
40056,"Please leave out statues alone, they didn't harm anyone. Those who don't learn from history are due to repeat it.

40214,"It seems almost inconceivable that I find myself replying to question about art that states in the question ""can be interpreted to be honoring bigotry, racism and/or slavery."" Can be interpreted? If we are going to have a real conversation about art and the spaces we create, let's at least have an honest conversation. There is no other way to interpret the Confederacy. Kentucky has a long history of trying to appear as if it was neutral when it came to slavery but in fact Kentucky was a conduit to the South and sold many Black men, women and children literally down the river. Kentucky's history runs a lot deeper than bourbon and bluegrass. If we are calling ourself a compassionate city how can we be compassionate by placing monuments around our state that honor those that played a part in some of the most if not the most heinous crimes against humanity? We have control over the spaces that we create. We decide if we want those spaces to be inclusive or exclusive? To have to get online and complete a form to once again speak to and make a plea for my humanity, to make a plea to feel welcomed in my city is ridiculous. Would we ask Jewish people to complete a form on whether a statue of Hitler may or may not be offensive? It seems every time it has something to do with Black people it must be debated, discussed and proven before people will just listen to what we say.

40204,"I think it's pretty clear what these statues represent--and it's not history or art. What they represent, in even the best light, is a division. Our city, made up heavily of both Liberals and Conservatives, people of all color, of all religions, of many national origins, sexual orientation and identity, should not allow such symbols of separation conquer us.

I've been passing by the piece of Castleman for a long time without realizing what it represented, but I'm not talking just of the Confederate statues, either. The George Prentice statue, for example, is a clear form of hate. All of these monuments of monstrosities need to be taken away before what happened in Charlottesville happens in Louisville. Don't let the white supremacists and neo-Nazis that hide in the shadows of our city feel welcome in Louisville any longer. We do not welcome the unwelcoming here. Our hospitality does not extend to the inhospitable.

If you feel that these Jim Crow-era and second KKK uprising-era statues truly do convey history, then put them in a museum. Replace them as monuments with historical figures that exemplify our great and diverse city."
40216,"Leave the statues alone.  Its history, lessons learned.  People need to get over themselves.  "
40205,"You should remove the statue and replace it with an explanatory plaque describing the standards used for this decision; i.e.,  why it was removed.
   As an example: such-and-such a statue has, on this date, been removed ""in an effort to finally correct a misleading interpretation of the civil war, its causes and its true heroes.""- or some other thoughtfully accurate explanation. Taking the statue down is an act of corrective history long overdue."
40217,"Statues are forms of public homage to individuals and commemoration of events. Although some honor tragic events because of those who lost their lives, such as the 9/11 memorial or the Trail of Tears monument at the Cherokee Heritage Center in Oklahoma, they rarely honor oppressors, with the exception of those whose sole recognition comes from the Confederate cause. Frankly, everything we need and want to learn about the Confederacy can be taken from a book. We do not need homage paid to an individual who is solely recognized for their association with the Confederacy. I say spare the adulation and relocate the statues to one of Kentucky's eight or so Confederate cemeteries or the Civil War battlefields. For what it is worth, I am a white, native Kentuckian whose ancestor fought in the 43rd Georgia Regiment."
40204,"I have a very curious six year old son, and we walk by the Castleman statue on Cherokee several times a month, and I am dreading the day that he asks me who that man was and why we put up a statue of him.  It is a shameful thing for our neighborhood and our city to honor men who fought to preserve our greatest national sin.  The statue needs to come down.

What if we honored a hero of the Civil War instead of a villain?  If Harriet Tubman is good enough for the twenty dollar bill, surely she is good enough for the Cherokee Triangle.  Nobody anywhere has ever claimed that she was not a legitimate hero, an example of staggering courage.  

Words from Frederick Douglass on Tubman:

""You ask for what you do not need when you call upon me for a word of commendation. I need such words from you far more than you can need them from me, especially where your superior labors and devotion to the cause of the lately enslaved of our land are known as I know them. The difference between us is very marked. Most that I have done and suffered in the service of our cause has been in public, and I have received much encouragement at every step of the way. You, on the other hand, have labored in a private way. I have wrought in the day—you in the night. ... The midnight sky and the silent stars have been the witnesses of your devotion to freedom and of your heroism. Excepting John Brown—of sacred memory—I know of no one who has willingly encountered more perils and hardships to serve our enslaved people than you have."""
40215,"Please remove the statues in question regardless of how persons react with leanings to bigotry, racism, and/or slavery.
These forms of historical documents can be viewed in a different manner that is controllable by historical context of truth relevant to bigotry, racism, and/or slavery, I.E. in a museum-type exhibition. 
When erecting replacements we should think forward on how public art should encourage those of the future generations, since those are the citizens that will questions - such as we are doing now - the true validity of the work of art separated by time from its initial meaning.
I look forward, as a constituent of Jefferson County, to see how our representatives play their hands in this matter. "
40214,"Please leave all of the statues of the Confederate Army/soldiers where they are. The Castleman statue specifically needs to be left where it is. That statue is NOT a military statue. It was put in place to honor all the things he done for Louisville, not his military service. As the daughter of a 32yr Army Veteran I would be upset to see these statues removed. They were put in place to honor the men who died for the country they loved. If you remove these statues, what is next? It's a slippery slope when you start doing things like removing history, where does it end? Do we dig up graves in Cave Hill Cemetery? Do we remove the tombstones? Do we build a mall at Gettysburg? Take down the Lincoln memorial? You can never please everyone, some won't be happy until all semblance of the Civil War is gone. Then what do you have? A history that has been so changed and desecrated that it has no semblance of truth left. Then how will our future generations learn that when we forget history and don't learn from it, we will be doomed to repeat it? Please let our history in our city stand as a warning that as human beings we must learn to live together. For a country divided among itself cannot stand.
Thank you.."
40229,"Hello.  As a person who lives in the Metro I wanted to offer my opinion on all of this.

Let me start by saying that I find the idea of racism repulsive and I have never understood the continued use of Confederate imagery.  That said, the idea behind the removal of the Cherokee Triangle statue is deeply flawed.  It doesn't celebrate bigotry, racism, or slavery.  It celebrates a man who has a rich history which just happens to include the fact that he fought in the Civil War.

The argument for it's removal is essentially that he was a Confederate officer during the Civil War.  That ignores everything else about the man.  The fact that after his stay of execution and exile from the United States he returned to service and rose to be a Brigadier General.  The fact that he was a guiding force behind many of the great parks that we have in the Metro.  It ignores everything except for the one argument that fits the narrative that these protesters want to push.

I lived off of Grinstead Dr for a time and Cherokee Triangle was one of the many places I would walk my dogs.  The first time I saw this statue I had to see what it said.  Then, I had to know more about it.  It was a piece of history for the area in and it drew me in.  The same with many other pieces of art my family has happened on here in Louisville and elsewhere.  It gave character.

For whomever reads this, I have a honest question for you.  Where does it stop?  For years now people have been finding offense behind something new on a daily basis.  It's a never ending cycle of new found offense.  The removal of this statue or other pieces of art around the Metro won't appease the people asking for their removal.  It'll just remove landmarks, art, and most importantly history from our city.  It'll just encourage the next protest.

Please don't encourage this type of complaint and please don't encourage the removal of our history."
40204,Leave the statues. Prosecute vandalism. March peacefully if we need to. I abhor racism and am not silent if it shows it's ugly head in my friends or family. Change the world by our love and acceptance and speaking the truth with peace. 
40214,"I believe the concerns over the Castleman statue focus on a small part of what this man did. He did serve in the Confererate army, but was pardoned. Why are we not accepting this pardon?  Instead of focusing on this one aspect of his life, focus on all the good he did for his community. Change the sign if needed to recognize the positive. I doubt the intent of those who honored him in 1913 was to honor his confederate service. We do a disservice to those who erected this statue if we remove it. Let's recognize the positive!"
40208,"Please do not remove the art. It's just that, Art. To be looked upon, pondered, to bring emotions both good, bad, sad, etc. 

Thank you. "
40220,"The Castleman statue should remain in place as it is a landmark and a part of our history.  Many of us have lived in the Highlands at one time or another and walked/driven around that majestic monument and NEVER given a thought to anything racist and still don't think of it as racist.  Our history must be remembered along with the bad and the good.  What's next??
If you really want to know what the citizens think..............take a vote."
40204,"I am supportive of the removal of public art that honors or memorializes any ideology that includes elements of racism, discrimination, support for slavery, and any others that run counter to the democratic ideals of the United States. Public art that depicts persons or acts related to the Confederate side of the US Civil War meets this criteria in my view.

At the sites where any such public art is removed, I recommend a tree(s) be planted as a neutral symbol of new life, growth, love for out planet (and to meet the goal of increasing Louisville's tree canopy). An act to swap out public art on one side of the issue with alternative public art will  be deemed as a victory for one and a loss for another, thereby working against the common goal we all share - to reside in a peaceful, inclusive, compassionate community that encourages all to live their best life. Thank you for your efforts to advance that aim."

40258,"Leave the statues alone.... they have sat in their spots, some for over 100 years ....now all of a sudden they are offensive?  Just because someone is offended does not give them a right to infringe upon the rights of others....if the city is willing to remove these statues are they  also willing to change street names again  (Louis Coleman , MLK, Dr WJ Hodge, Dixie Hwy) ? The city willing to remove the Lincoln statue in Waterfront park? how about removing the statue in front of city hall,  King Louis ?   What about the Vietnam Memorial in front of the Govt Building on Dixie Hwy?  Just food for thought "
40217,"Move any and all confederate statues to Brandenburg, if they will have them, and they can have a museum where the complete history is told. The war was fought over slavery and the majority of ky soldiers fought for the union.  These confederates should not have prominent places in our city or state. "
40217,Please remove any statue or memorial honoring any Confederate soldier that was erected after 1900
40205,"Castleman represents the absolutely worst character trait: segregation. If he is remembered for anything, it should be that he segregated the parks system.

Castleman should be donated to the American Saddlebred Museum at the Kentucky Horse Park. It doesn't belong on a city pedestal. There are plenty other people who could be honored in this public space, such as: Muhammad Ali (who still should have the airport named after him), Anne and Carl Braden, the Shawnee Native Americans, Enid Yandell, or Sue Grafton to name a few. 

The Highlands represents the best of Louisville: inclusivity, diversity, unique and quirky small businesses, and people coming together.

40217,"Some people say they want to keep Confederate statues like the Castleman to ""remember history,"" while some seem nostalgic for it as a ""neighborhood landmark."" Others simply seem to be enchanted by their ""beauty."" That these statues were erected to promote white supremacy, intimidate POC, and embolden racists at the expense of people's lives is inconsequential to them. Change is hard, I get it. I'm just glad we have the opportunity to voice our opinions here. You know who didn't get to voice their opinions? Slaves. Take these glorified symbols of oppression down. In time we can replace them with works of art that better reflect the values which so many Louisvillians claim. "
40204," Is it in the spirit of a Compassionate city to celebrate someone who fought for the enslavement of others?
I think its time to rid the city of all monuments that celebrate the civil war and its heroes.
While many in Louisville didn't realize the Castleman statue was a civil war statue, it is on the historic registry as a civil war monument. That was its intention when it was created. Look at the context of history of the time the statue was erected, these monuments were put into place to reinforce Jim Crow.
Now I understand that the corridor where this statue is placed is not a particularly diverse area, and many will say that they (the residents who are white and affluent) are not offended and that they do not see it that way, should we not take into account the rest of the neighborhood, city, and tourists. What message are we sending? 
Do we want the kind of visitor who will come looking for a civil war monument? Do we want the message the statue celebrates to be the one that the rest of the citizens of Louisville hear? Is it in the spirit of a Compassionate city to celebrate someone who fought for the enslavement of others?

40223,"I believe that history should never be forgotten or destroyed. Confederate monuments have their place in society, to remind us of what our country went through during the Civil War and the people who were involved. As an artist, I understand the artistic value of the sculptures themselves. However, I am also of the firm belief that these Confederate monuments do not belong on display in our shared public spaces and should be removed & relocated. The intent of these monuments is to glorify the defenders of slavery and secession, shameful blemishes on American history that should not be placed on a pedestal. They do nothing to represent the strength of our nation and our current fight for equality. They do nothing to reflect American virtues, nor do they reflect progress or hope in a country that is still suffering from racial injustice, tension, and violence. Change needs to happen to help us move forward, and this occurs partly in what we choose to occupy the spaces we share. Today, these monuments symbolize racism and the oppression of African Americans. The people of Louisville deserve public art that inspires hope and reflects our beautiful city in a positive, progressive way. We can not and should not keep these monuments up any longer. Other cities have already taken action toward removing their Confederate monuments from public display, and if Louisville does not follow suit, we will be ignorantly resistant to progress. If they are not removed, I will not vote for you in the next election. Thank you."
40206,"In my opinion, the statue of Mr Castleman should be removed.  Mr Castleman fought for the Confederacy in rebellion against the United States and the underlying motivation for that rebellion was the preservation of slavery.  My understanding of Mr Castleman's life post-Civil War was after his pardon by President Johnson, he served in the US military, apparently with distinction.  He also receives some credit for the development of Louisville's park system.  Additionally, Mr Castleman founded the National Saddlebred Horse Association.  So certainly he should receive credit for his contributions, but does this mean his statue should remain in place?

I recently read an article that described how many Confederate monuments were placed outside of court houses.  The article's author asked, how could minorities, historically African-Americans, expect justice when they have to walk by a monument to their enslavement and subjugation?  The statue of Mr Castleman presents him in civilian clothing, not military uniform, so is this a tribute to the man post-Civil War and his contributions to Louisville?  The Courier-Journal cites the occasion after the park's establishment of African-Americans playing tennis and Mr Castleman responding that equal (which of course it never has been) and separate facilities should be provided to them.  To me, this indicates that Mr Castleman was a segregationist and perhaps what we would call today, a white supremacist.

Therefore, in the same way that Confederate monuments in front of court houses call into question the justice people of certain categories may receive, allowing Mr Castleman's statue to remain at an entrance to the park suggests not all are welcome into this public space.  It is for these reasons that I support the immediate removal of the Castleman monument.

"
40205,"Confederate statues were both an attempt to revise history by presenting the Confederacy as honorable, and a threatening reminder to POC that they were not welcome where these statues stood. Why would we want to uphold that kind of hate? Take them down along with any other art that tries to preserve white supremacy. "
40203,"Statues and memorials glorifying images of the Confederacy have no place in this country; the stated purpose of the Confederacy was to uphold the institution of slavery, period. Defenders of these Confederate monuments may want to claim that they honor the sacrifice of these individual soldiers, who may not themselves have advocated for slavery, but guess what? Many German soldiers in World War II weren't subscribers of Nazi ideology either, yet when you go to Germany today you don't see Swaztikas or statues honoring fallen Nazi soldiers displayed in the public square. That's because most Germans have spent the last 70 years atoning for their collective sin and seeking ways to ensure that nothing like Nazism ever takes root in their country again. America has never atoned for the sin of slavery - removing all Confederate monuments from our city and our country will be a small step in the right direction. "
40205,"Any statue that celebrates racism or racists should be removed.  The following excerpt on John Breckinridge Castleman is from the courier journal.  Thank you.

""Castleman also contributed to another, darker, park legacy. When a group of African-Americans played tennis at Cherokee Park, the slave-raised Castleman responded by segregating the tennis courts. When some of the city’s whites thought that didn’t go far enough, Castleman agreed.

In the pages of this newspaper in 1916, Castleman wrote, “We have inexcusably neglected to provide recreation grounds for our negro fellow citizens,” implying that none of the existing parks were for African Americans. “These people are citizens,” he condescended. “The same right that induces our liberal provision for their separate education should impel us to provide for them separate recreation grounds.”

Four years after Castleman died and three years after Cowan was dead, the city built the 61-acre Chickasaw Park as a consolation prize “for the use of negroes.”  The remaining Olmsted parks weren’t re-integrated until after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 1954. ""

40204,I live on Cherokee Road and I believe that residents of the Cherokee Triangle neighborhood should be the ones to vote on what should happen to the Castleman Statue. I would like to hear a statement from the Mayor's office about whether or not his contribution to the Louisville Parks is accurate or if Castleman pursued segregation of the parks. It is in my opinion that no one ever stopped to think about who the statue was or what it represented until all of these stories came out so what does it matter now? 
40218,"I would review the George Prentice monument by the Main Public Library.  He was supposedly for slavery, anti-Catholic and anti-immigrant.  His writings probably started the Bloody Monday incident of 1855.  Thanks. "
40204,Thanks for being proactive.  I was part of the discussions a few years ago about the statutes in the Capitol Rotunda and I realized we should acknowledge our history by keeping many of these pieces - but in a museum or some other contextual space which makes it clear that we are examining our past.  When you keep such pieces in the public space in general it suggests the community is honoring the pieces and what they mean.  General public space should be about uniting and uplifting our entire community.
40202,"I initially intended to give a list of what genreally are considered to be great men  and then list the reasons why someone would demand that any statues, memorials, etc., be removed or changed. 
 My intention in doing so would not have been to call for the removal of these things but to ask that the commission in its reviews remember that,  ""the evil that men do lives after them. The good is off interred with their bones. "" So said Shakespeare.
 Louisville has always been a diverse, forward moving, community that has maintained a sold connection with its past. 
 I ask that commission remember all of this as it conducts it's reviews and conducts them with open minds as to how its decisions will affect the WHOLE community for years to come, and not make its decisions just to satisfy the most vocal or extreme points  of view.

 In short, all I'm asking is that you not throw the baby out with the bathwater. "
40205,"The mindless plague of leftist iconoclasm currently sweeping our nation blew into the Bluegrass State this weekend, and with a vengeance.  The city council of Charlottesville, Virginia (home of Tom Jefferson’s University of Virginia), decided to move a venerated equestrian statue of General Robert E. Lee to another location, and a motley collection of Nazis, Klansmen, and assorted skinheads demonstrated in opposition to the move. 

Charlottesville issued the protesters a permit to march around with their torches and flags, then later relented; forcing the ACLU to go into federal court to get a writ for the group to exercise their First Amendment rights.

An equally horrid group of left-wing loonies (mostly Antifa and BLM paid provocateurs) were bused into Charlottesville, and the ensuing melee (observed, but not thwarted, by local police) left one woman dead and scores injured.

Eager to jump in front of this wave of silliness, Lexington Mayor Jim (50 Shades Of) Gray announced on Saturday that he would be moving that city’s confederate monuments to some spot even more invisible to locals and tourists than their current out of the way locations.  This act of modern liberal bravery got Mayor Jim on the front page of The Washington Post, and garnered him more national publicity than he has received since he came out of the closet to run for the Senate against Rand Paul.

Not to be outdone, Louisville’s beloved mayor, Greg Fischer, announced on Sunday that he was appointing a commission to review the placement and possible removal of statues and objets d'art around town that might be giving any sort of offense to Derbytown’s precious snowflakes.

Fischer—who has always been a cure in search of a disease—stated that he wanted to start a “community conversation” to find a solution to a problem nobody even knew existed, until Dr. Ricky Jones came to town with his race-baiting agenda.  ""We need to discuss and interpret our history from multiple perspectives and from different viewpoints. That's why a community conversation is crucial,"" said Hizzhonor, with as close to a straight face as he could muster up for the occasion.

Then, parties unknown (but we suspect you know who) doused General John Breckinridge Castleman’s statue with orange paint.  The old general has been sitting astride his faithful mount, near the entrance to Cherokee Park, for more than a century; beloved by his neighbors, and apparently giving offense to no one. 

But, as the weekend came to a close, a ragtag coalition of Louisville’s Usual Suspects started marching, waving signs, and circulating petitions to remove Castleman, the horse he rode in on, and every other historical symbol in town that might cause them to swoon with the vapors.  The West End commies from The Karl Braden Center marched up Broadway, and even that old lefty Carla Wallace took time away from her menagerie of strange animals out on Rose Island Road to lead this latest crusade against hurt feelings.

Poor Mayor Fischer.  He will doubtless discover that putting the lid back on this can of worms he has opened may prove to be a bit more difficult than anticipated.  If he thinks he can out-pander and out-sissy Jim Gray, he is sadly mistaken.  Gray has years of experience at this sort of thing, and Fischer is a relative newcomer to the field of pusillanimous political posturing.  

The foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding (we lawyers just love using that phrase, even when it’s not really appropriate), we herewith offer some suggestions to our beloved mayor, to arm him with a little historical perspective as he enters into his much-needed “community conversation.”  We agree with him that all symbols and vestiges of bigotry and racist oppression need to be excised from our fair city, and the following are but a mere handful of the more egregious racial insults, left over from the bad old days, which Louisvillians are forced to confront in their daily perambulations:

1.  Statues of slave owners.  Greg Fischer can look out his office window and see the bronze representation of that notorious slave-master and accused interracial-rapist Thomas Jefferson; standing atop an oversized replica of the Liberty Bell.  The fact that this glaring insult to black folk is situated on Jefferson Street, and in Jefferson County, only adds salt to this wound. 

In the rotunda of Metro Hall, Greg can see the life-sized marble statue of slave-master Henry (‘druther be right than president) Clay, and across the street—on the other side of Jefferson (!) Square Park, he can see the bust of the Marquis de Lafayette; another reprehensible slave owner (the marquis was reprehensible, not his slaves).  When Jim Gray finds out that Lexington is located in Fayette County—named after that infamous slaver frog—there will surely be hell to pay.

2.  Streets named after slave owners.  Louisville—perhaps in more innocent times—has named a number of its streets and roads after cruel slave-masters.  The likes of Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, John Hancock, James Madison, George Washington, Andrew Jackson, Zachary Taylor, Isaac Shelby, John Tyler, Robert E. Lee, William Preston, John C. Breckinridge, and Henry Clay, have their names plastered on street signs all over town:  A slap in the face to every red-blooded American patriot.  (In the case of that old Indian-fighter Andy Jackson, it’s a slap in the face to red-blooded red men also.)

And, speaking of Indians (that’s what Native Americans are calling themselves nowadays), something definitely needs to be done about all of Louisville’s parks which are named after Indian tribes.  Iroquois, Cherokee, Seneca, Shawnee, Algonquin, and Chickasaw Indians—when they weren’t murdering, raping, scalping, and pillaging Louisville’s early settlers—were happy to capture, buy, sell, and generally mistreat slaves of all races.

3.  Lasting tributes to Louisville’s slave-trading families.  The Clark and Speed families, honored founders of our little town by the Ohio River waterfall, were, of course, leading slave-traders.  Revolutionary War hero George Rogers Clark has a street, a park, and a bridge named after him; as well as a larger-than-life statue on the Belvedere.  When he wasn’t slaughtering Indians and enslaving black folks, he took time out to name J-Town after fellow slave-master Thomas J.  Who among us can deny that the name of this miscreant should be erased for posterity?

As for the notorious Speed family, sure, they have been honored by having a street, an art museum, and an Engineering school named after them; but who can possibly ignore the horrors that occurred at their slave-estate, Farmington, located conveniently across the street from Heine Brothers' Coffee Shop, in the Gardiner Lane Shopping Center?  Does Mayor Fischer really want black University of Louisville Engineering students to have to suffer the disrespect and indignity of being assaulted by the ignominious name “Speed,” every time they enter their classroom building?  Okay, so maybe there aren’t really many black University of Louisville Engineering students, but that’s a problem for another day.  (Regardless of what you may have heard, the Speed family—while certainly notorious slave-traders—was in no way connected with the development, production, or distribution of methamphetamine.  I want to clear that up.)

4.  Old Hank Watterson is a case by himself.  The guy who started our local “newspaper,” “Marse Henry” Watterson was a pretty nasty piece of work.  Louisville has named a street, an interstate expressway, and an office park after him; despite the fact that he rode alongside that bloodthirsty confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest, during our Civil War To Protect Slavery.  You will remember that Gen. Forrest, a prominent Democrat, was one of the founders of the Ku Klux Klan.  Watterson won a Pulitzer Prize for writing hateful editorials against good old Kaiser Bill, right before Judge Bingham fired him and made his boy Barry editor of The Courier-Journal.  If you don’t believe me, you can google “famous Louisville racists.”

5.  Miscellaneous racists.  Founding Father Sam Chase was a Maryland slave-owner, and started a bank which later merged with The House of Morgan.  There are numerous branches of Chase Bank all around Louisville, and their ubiquitous signage is a painful reminder of chattel-slavery and man’s inhumanity to man.  Can nothing be done about this?

Finally, there’s the problem of Spalding University.  Originally Nazareth College, and then, later, Catherine Spalding College, the school is named after the founder of Kentucky’s Sisters of Charity, M0ther Catherine Spalding.  And, you guessed it, M0ther Catherine and her little order of nuns owned Negro slaves.  Sure, they subsequently kicked the habit, but what reasonably sensitive person can drive past Spalding’s campus without hearing the faint crack of the overseer’s whip?

So, my advice to Mayor Fischer is--now that he has uncovered this festering wound of bigotry and hatred, here in the heart of our wonderful and formerly peaceful little city by the river--he needs to eschew his customary half-assed approach to problem solving.  Forget about our opioid epidemic, our economic stagnation, our failing school system, our rotten sewer system, our potholed streets, our decrepit infrastructure, and all those dead bodies littering the streets of our West End.  He needs to devote his attention 24/7 to this new and previously unknown crisis.  He needs to stamp out all remaining symbols and vestiges of racial intolerance and injustice.  He needs to create another committee."
40205,"The statue of David, standing in front of Louisville's 21C Hotel, is of a slave-owner and confessed adulterer. It is a bigoted insult to Phillistine-Americans, and needs to be pulled down immediately."
40204,"I hope the Commission focuses on historical context and does not respond to emotions of the present.  Yes, some public art, if fairly judged as  ""bigotry, racism, and/or slavery"" should be removed and replaced.

But we need a calm, thoughtful, process over some period of time, as much of the cry for action is related to frustration and disappointment in very recent events.

I see myself as a progressive and live in one of the most progressive neighborhoods in Louisville.  The Castleman statue is a particular challenge.  Anything with ""confederate"" in it raises the slavery emotion.  But Castleman redeemed himself and served in the US Army.  In my opinion, the plague should be changed to emphasize WHY that statute is up - not for Civil War service, but for local civic leadership, especially the parks system.  If John Castleman was in Confederate uniform and/or carried military weapons or flag then I too would support its removal.

But if the non-military Castleman should come down, so should the honorific naming of many of our streets, buildings, and counties.  Those men lived real lives in an era that also did not meet the standards of today's culture.  We hold Abraham Lincoln himself as a critical figure in racial equality, and his Memorial is the site for so many expressions of this good.  It too should come down, for in his own words he stated clearly that blacks should not be allowed to vote, serve on a jury, or hold office.  Those words make me sick today, but I he wouldn't say them today.  Neither would Castleman necessarily act or say today what he did 150 years ago.

So I hope you balance the true insult some public art provokes for our fellow citizens with the tyranny of the present.  "
40241,"I say take it down. My reasons are based on Castleman's description on

34. John Breckinridge Castleman Monument

The statue's inscription says that his friends ""loved and respected him as a noble patriot, a gallant soldier, a useful citizen-Major Gen. C.S.A. retired Brigadier Gen., U.S.A.""  However, the article's abbreviated biography presents a different picture: 

""... John B. Castleman joined John Hunt Morgan's men in 1862 and led guerrilla missions of his own as well. His escapades included attempting to free POWs from Camp Douglas near Chicago and burning U. S. supply boats at St. Louis. In October 1864 he was captured and sentenced to death for spying, but President Lincoln suspended the execution. After Lincoln's assassination, Castleman was banished from the United States until pardoned in 1866...""

Ironic that Castleman, like America's slaves, owed his eventual freedom to Lincoln. "
40175,"If CONFEDERATE monuments and statues are removed, so must Union monuments and statues must be removed. That includes ALL memorials to Abraham Lincoln. History is history. Confederate soldiers died and Union soldiers died. Removal of any of these memorials only denigrate the memory of American veterans. What it in the future people decide that all Vietnam vets were traitors, and the Vietnam memorials should be destroyed ? When does it end ? IT ENDS NOW !"
40204,"Please don't remove the Castleman statue. Castleman is portrayed in a regular suit on his Standardbred horse, completely in context with the fact that he started the National Saddle Horse Breeder's Association. Please change the sign to highlight his civic activities after serving as a U.S. General and leave the statue in place. "
40205,"While I don't belive there are any more ""confederate"" memorials outside of cemeteries, I think if the City considers removing ""offensive"" statues aka ""memorials"", that they coordinate with a museum to take them from a historical perspective and offer context and provenance. "
40214,"I can understand why there are individuals who are upset with Civil War statues but my argument is with the Prentice's statue that is displayed in front of the city library.  George Prentice through his position with the fore runner to the Courier Journal instigated a riot on the Catholic citizens of the City. From 22 to 2000 Catholics were killed and 100's of homes and businesses were burned others were expelled to southern Indiana and Cincinnati.  It should also be noted that he was an appointed of slavery.  Please give the statue back to the Courier Journal. I and others must cringe when entering the Library when this man who killed my ancestors is promoted every time we enter the Library.  My heritage is both Irish  and German plus being a member of Catholic religion.  I am aware that there are  historic signs that to some extent that mention this atrocity. But the current Mayor is not likely to place signs next to Civil War statues given past actions.  If you have doubts to  what I have written look up Black Monday and George Prentice.  When I went to Catholic School many years ago these actions were taught as history. One of the nuns who taught me had relatives killed in this atrocity.  I have tried in the past to have the statue moved to no avail. Please give this letter a fair reading. To me this Is more pressing than a General who fought for a slave state. I do approve of consideration given to the persons who had statues made in their likeness so long it is fairly investigate

40207,"The largest mass execution of the Indians was authorized by Abraham Lincoln, and Louisville named a bridge after him.  This is a fraction of the Indians slaughtered and displaced by the Lincoln presidency.  Please note the number of times Lincoln told the Indians to acquiesce to the white man's way of living.  No man or woman is perfect; and, therefore, the city would be void of art commemorating our history if we apply the current thought process. Our statues are part of our history that we need to revisit, whether positive or negative, or we are at risk of repeating it.  We use art to teach history.  Eliminating art by applying today's standards of cultural acceptability would rob us of historical art."
40299,"This is insanity! Our city has SO many more pressing problems! Try removing heroin first!
"
40205,"I feel there is no black or white aspect on the Public Art in and on Louisville land, it is a grey area that is a very slippery slope. My thoughts and feelings of the ""celebration"" of a statue or monument goes far beyond an isolated period of an individuals life, but that person's life as a whole. I feel saddened John B Castleman sided with the CSA during the Civil War, but we should not forget the fact he fought during the Spanish-American War and served the USA after the conclusion of the Civil War. While he may not have been as impacting as Andrew Cowan for the Olmsted Parks in Louisville, I do feel he had a very significant role in forming Louisville's parks as we enjoy them today. During the time of segregation he was instrumental in the formation of beautiful Chickasaw Park. Casdtleman founded the ASHA in 1891, an organization that still continues to this day and brings much attention to the Commonwealth. I do feel the measure of the man's life is larger than that period of time between 1861 to 1865. If we remove a statue of a man in civilian clothing and a plaque talking about his CSA service, then we need to change the names of the parks in this city. We would need to remove the statues of Daniel Boone (a major contributor to this area), and George D Prentice (a man that seems to have less impact on this city than any other monument in the city) due to their history. I do not think there is a definitive right or wrong answer to this scenario, but I do believe the person as a whole has to be considered when weighing the option of removing monuments that families (along with public funds) have erected and other citizens have restored, looked after and cared for, for over 100 years. These were different times, we can not change this or relate to in today's times.

Sincerely
J.R. Schloemer"
40204,"I strongly object to the recent press characterizing the Castleman statue as a Confederate monument! Castleman is shown in civilian equestrian clothes on his favorite horse, Caroline. Castleman helped found the American Saddlebred Association and was a Brigadier General in the US Army. 
Are we going to erase all references to the Lewis and Clark expedition and remove York's statue from the Belvedere because he was Clark's slave? History has already happened. We cannot change the past! Educate! "
40205,"""While I can understand why some people would strongly disagree, I’d like to respectfully offer a different perspective. My opinion that those monuments should be left alone isn’t because I support the horrible things that have been done in our history. It’s exactly the opposite.
Every country’s history has a dark spot in it. More than one, if we’re being honest. But the fact that we aren’t still mired in those dark places means that we have made strides toward becoming better. Erasing history, though, is a dangerous path because it means that the truth becomes something malleable that has been created instead of recorded.
Without our history, good or bad, who are we? If we don’t remember where we came from, how can we hope to continuously improve? If we can’t learn from the mistakes of the past, and if the truth is “created” by the vocal minority, then how does the truth even exist anymore?
History teaches us important lessons.
We’ve all heard that quote, “Those who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it.” So what happens when we completely erase it?
Erasing the negative part of history doesn’t make it go away Sanitizing the facts doesn’t mean that they never happened. It just means no one can learn from them.
Good, bad, and ugly, this is part of our national story. 
I strongly denounce these groups who are filled with hatred for their fellow Americans.
While I believe these historic monuments should not be destroyed, I certainly could never align myself with the neo-Nazis, the KKK, and the Alt-Right people who are protecting them, because they’re doing so out of hatred and a misplaced sense of glory. Nor would I ever align myself with the Antifa, the most ironic group ever in existence that proclaims to be against fascism but noisily and brutally stifles the First Amendment rights of those with whom they disagree.
These groups all represent what is worst about our country. Violence, vandalism, hatred, and terror are wrong, no matter who is perpetrating those acts.
In any argument, it’s always the loudest people who get heard, but that doesn’t mean they speak for everyone. We must be careful not to over-generalize when it comes to these groups.
The Alt-Right and the neo-Nazis cannot be confused with every conservative Republican out there any more than the Alt-Left and the Antifa can be confused with every liberal Democrat. All of these labels are divisive and painting everyone with a broad brush is a lazy generalization. But this isn’t what the media is telling us. Instead, the mainstream media is pouring gasoline on this fire on a daily basis and they’re polarizing our country even more.
Most of us are decent human beings who have no argument with our fellow Americans. We have a lot more in common than this noisy minority and if we could respectfully find those points of agreement, we could, perhaps, find peace amongst our neighbors once again.
I only hope that we haven’t gone so far down this road that there’s no way back.""

40214,"The city of Louisville should use public art to make statements that lift up ALL the citizens of the city. Public art can and should be inspiring, or thought provoking, aesthetically pleasing, or . It should not make people feel ashamed, scared, sad or marginalized. We can have public art that people will travel to our city to see, like the murals in Miami, or the kidney bean in Chicago. We can raise money to commission art that will help put Louisville on the map in a positive way. Art that is uniquely Louisville, art that excites young artists in the city. Public art should be seen as an OPPORTUNITY!
Please remove statues that stand for groups that fought on the side of intolerance. Please remove statues that potentially force our citizens to have conversations with their children about why we have monuments of people who fought for slavery. Don't let the children of this city grow up thinking that a park is pro-slavery, or a University is pro-slavery. Please remove statues that make citizens of our city feel ashamed, scared, sad or marginalized. 

Thank-you"
40217,"Please take down all of the Confederate statues in the city. The losers in history do not get monuments in their honor. Removing these statues is not erasing history - people of color live with the trauma of this past every day. It is a part of daily life for us. Racism is as real and as present as it has ever been, and we need a city that stands firm against this. Mayor Jim Gray and the city of Lexington serve as a shining example of what this city should have already accomplished this week. 

Thank you"
40272,"Any statue that is on the National Historic Registry should not be touched. History should not be sanitized, as it is neither right nor wrong and needs to be contemplated on completely, the good , the bad, and the ugly. It should be remembered so the events of the future cannot be a repeat of the past. This is a very slippery slope and I find myself asking what is next. Do we start removing books like Tom Sawyer or Uncle Tom's Cabin from the library, or start closing the National Battlefields where the South was victorious? Any person that feels a statue erected as a remembrance to events that unfolded 160 years ago could possibly be hindering them from realizing their god given potential in 2017, has an incredibly weak self worth.
"
40204,"Leave the Castleman statue and change the marker to reflect the reason for its existence.
The statue represents Castleman's success in August of 1890 to establish the Board of Parks Commissioners.  He is credited for securing the property for Cherokee Park and overseeing its development. As president he initiated the development of Louisville's park system, including Cherokee Park.  He rode his saddle bred horse Carolina through that park almost every day.
He founded the American Saddle Horse Breeders Association and served as its president for 28 years.
The statue does not represent a Civil War general - he is not in uniform.  It was intended to show Castleman on his horse, Carolina, overlooking the entrance to the park he help to create.  This is why the statue should and must remain and the content of the marker should be changed to reflect that.

40229,"If you are someone who has a negative reaction to the removal of confederate monuments, please read and consider the following: 

""Most Confederate monuments were built in periods of racial conflict, such as when Jim Crow laws were introduced at the start of the 20th century or during the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s.""

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_monuments_and_memorials_of_the_Confederate_States_of_America

This historical context is SO IMPORTANT. Firstly, we should not honor anyone who wages war on America in the first place. Secondly, these monuments were largely erected during the Jim Crow era or in the 60's as a DIRECT statement on race relations, a slap in the face to African Americans who were being lynched and beaten and fighting for their rights to exist in those public spaces. We can't undo history, but we can decide who we want to honor in our public squares and who deserves a pedestal. 

The Confederate flag flown by the alt-right this weekend was the flag of General Lee, who himself considered it a flag of treason and said, 

""I think it wisest not to keep open the sores of war, but to follow the example of those nations who endeavored to obliterate the marks of civil strife, and to commit to oblivion the feelings it engendered.""  

Even he and Jefferson Davis wanted healing over heralding the past. Most of these symbols weren't exalted until decades later when racist whites were threatened with desegregation and demands for equality. 

We cannot afford to continue to deflect and do nothing and expect to heal as a nation, so let's approach this with a critical collective mind and realize its a correction that needs to be made.

If there are pieces that tell complete truths about the ugliness and shame of slavery and our history, those pieces deserve to be shown. And I don't think it's necessary to remove memorials from cemeteries. But review the context in which the other monuments were placed. Were they erected with the intent to lower the morale of black citizens who were in a battle for their rights? Were they erected to terrorize the black community into submission so that the Jim Crow era could continue? Context matters, and the message we send to our future generations on this is so important. Perhaps, unintentionally and ironically, these rioting while supremacists have given us one small action that we can take to aid our nation in healing. "
40205,I think the statues and monuments should be left alone.I'm no fan of the confederacy but I don't see how this stops.if we remove or alter something every time someone's offended what will be left.is the removal of these statues only to pacify the offended?what happens when another group of people gets upset about something.tear it down?thats why we have a mayor havevthge guts to make a decision

Let me guess; MLK, MalcomX, Barack Obama? You do not learn from the mistakes of the past, by destroying and rewriting it. These are works of art, some of which are 100 years old or older.

Re: Statue Removal, potential, although Mayor Fischer appears to have capitulated to a select group who want them taken down

To Whom It May Concern:

First, let me start in the past: Samuel Johnson, who wrote the first dictionary, in 1755 AD,  and without whom we would likely not have the subsequent Oxford English Dictionary, and, I might add, most of our American law and its interpretation, defines History as:

1. A narration of facts delivered with dignity
2. Narration, relation
3. The knowledge of facts and events 

Why do I start here? Because in order to settle a question of 'what something means,' in its most basic sense, we are forced to look back to the most original definition of the word, its precedent. 

It is to the original dictionary of Samuel Johnson that law courts often turn when seeking a word or phrase's actual meaning.



Johnson then defines Historify:

1. To relate, to record in history

as well as History Piece:

1. A picture representing some memorable event
(I refrain from giving examples of the word usage both here and following, as that could be deemed presumptuous.)

The Oxford English Dictionary, also originally published in 1755 AD, worked on by Johnson as well as others, defines Histororical/Historick as:
1. Containing or giving an account of facts and events (sound familiar?)
2. Suitable or pertaining to history or narrative

and History as:
1. A narration of events and facts delivered with dignity
2. Narration, relation
3. The knowledge of facts and events

This gives us a clear basis as to what constitutes history, in actuality and in reality, as opposed to, say, what constitutes fairy tales. (I do not think I need to beleaguer you with examples of these here, both ancient and modern, as that, too, might be considered presumptuous.) Nowhere in the definition of the word History do the modifiers convenient or appease appear, in any form.

Throughout history, typical narration or relating of events has ranged from the written (recent, in terms of centuries, since we are speaking of the long view here and not the short-sighted one), and oral/spoken tradition, (ancient), such as the Bards of Ireland who were both Keepers of the Law and Tradition, as well as Poets. In fact, they were considered so vitally important that they had access to king's chambers (bed). Additionally, in Ireland were you to insult a Poet, you would be severely punished, as one King found out to his dismay. He lost his crown. To this day, Ireland reveres Poets and those who keep the tradition of oral history alive. 

This, Irish history, is also part of our American tradition, part of our history, but I note you have no monuments to the Irish slaves and indentured servants who came to this country to build canals, and work in coal mines, harbors, houses of land and robber barons and the like. 

Nor do I see any monuments to the Irish men, women and children who lost their lives in the fire set by those in Louisville, Kentucky who despised the rabbly Hibernians. There is a historical marker, a tiny plaque, somewhere on Main Street,  marking Bloody Monday,  August 1855 AD. I still remember when Palm Beach, Florida and other esteemed locations carried signs in their windows marked: NINA, No Irish Need Apply.

Do you have a statue to commemorate these prejudices, slights and deaths? I didn't think so.

Additionally, since we are dealing with prejudice, Louisville used to be a malaraial swamp. In fact, it had two homeopathic hospitals just for malaria alone. Do you have statues for those? No, I would guess not, that's just way too controversial to have in Hospital-ville, heaven forfend you expose the hypocrisy of truth. But Muhammad Ali/Casius Clay, a draft dodger, has a whole building, a whole street, and all kinds of monuments erected to him.

Ali made no secret of his hatred and contempt for white people as a whole.  And you immortalize him, just because he used to live here.

But I digress. You are considering removal of our history, period. What do you intend to replace this with? This smells very much like the Russian communist manifesto of the 1950s, as well as Berlin, Germany, in 1937.

You are considering this removal based on the squeaky wheels and complaints of a number of people, both people of color and people of no-color, you know, Pinkies, (also known as guilt-ridden whites), and the only thing these people as a whole have done is present you with one thing: an emotional, histrionic argument aimed towards revisionist teaching and display. 

Should you capitulate to this kind of revisionist thinking and argument of emotional appeal, you will be not only destroying our past, our history, but you will doom future generations--my grandchildren and great-grandchildren, and yours--to repeating it. Why? Because they, along with countless others, will not know their culture, their background, their history--in other words, they will not have the long view but only the NOW picture--and will be forced to repeat these very costly mistakes. Is this what you would do? Do you really want to lose your progeny to more wars? 

Do you really want to foment more unrest, like that in Charlottesville, Virginia, where mayor Mike Signer and Gov McAulliffe decided citizen/LEO hits were preferable to a budget hit? Is this what you would do? Reduce human life to a dollar value?  

What good then, is art? Does history not teach us to learn from our mistakes? Would you promulgate such an approach, and jeopardize future generations to satisfy the granite-lust and metal-lust and ""survivor guilt"" of those clamoring for statues to be removed?

Are these statues diseased? Are they rotten? Would you tell Rodin that? And Bartholdi--would you pull down Lady Liberty? Or how about  the descendants of Fred Olmstead--would you say, ""Sorry, this park sucks now, these people say so, we are mowing it down. You are tough out of luck."" Is that how you would treat our glorious parks? Tear them down because they do not meet certain people's expectations of what is politically correct and/or valid? And where does it stop? Do you comb every city, county and municipal building, looking for any art deemed offensive by any bleating, clamoring group? Do you shutter the Pendennis Club because of its segregated past? How about dismantling the Democratic Party since they sponsored the KKK? Why not shutter every school? Rename the streets? There is the rule of the greatest good for the greatest number of people, and then there is mob rule. Mobs rule and sway by emotion, last time I checked. I think you can reference Pontius Pilate for the most famous example in Western history.

You see, you are the last vanguard: not only do you preserve history by keeping these statues, though they may make some groups uncomfortable, you also allow people to learn. 

To fall prey to the theatrics of the ""barbarians at the gate"" who would have you destroy our heritage says only two things: Art does not count, whether modern or ancient, and, by extension, History doesn't count. 

And you rest on a very slippery slope: should you accommodate such passions, you will only regret the lack of reason you should rightly display in the face of emotional demands. For once you start down that path, there is no return. You give in, they own you, in street terms. 

In other words, you won't learn from your mistakes.

We are a nation of law. Law is based on precedent. Precedent is what came ""before""--in other words, history. History is built brick by brick, blood drop by blood drop, in an accumulation of effort, for generations and for centuries. These statues convey that, inform us of that, and logic says they stay.

I expect this letter to be made part of the official public record.

Very truly yours,
 
Irene Mosvold"

I am a person who lives around the corner from the Cherokee Triangle's Castleman statue, who lives on what was, at one point, most certainly Castleman land, & I am also in complete & full support of the neighborhood &/or city removing the Castleman statue from our public property.

It is time now to look at the past with honesty & move forward together, making our country—its history & its future—into a country for all of us."

That seems in-American. "
40206,"If a monument honors someone for actions they took to improve the community post Civil War and they are being honored for these acts rather than for their role as a member of the Confederacy, this should be a factor to consider in possibly allowing the monument to remain in public view.  If General Castleman's monument is honoring him for his role in promoting Louisville's public park system rather than for his role in the Civil War this should be part of our conversation.

On the other hand, if a monument is honoring someone solely for their role in supporting the Confederacy and the Civil War,  the monument should be removed to an educational setting or museum.  IF any of these monuments are allowed to stay in public view a very prominent plaque should be displayed alongside explaining the historical context of the Civil War and that Louisville and KY had divided sentiments during that period.  However, the message should be abundantly clear that these persons treasonous acts of succession and the misery and death they created in  our country represented the darkest time for our country, state and city."

40216,"I do not support removal of these statues and monuments. I will, however, support removal of any public officials who  votes to remove these statues and monuments."
40208,"As someone who spent the overwhelming majority of my adult life living in the Highlands, I am highly distressed at the idea that the statue of General John B. Castleman should be removed as a Confederate statue, because it is not such a statue.  If it celebrated his early military history in the Confederate army (in which of course a great many other Kentuckians also served), he would be portrayed wearing a Confederate uniform and carrying a weapon or two.  Nor does it celebrate his later military legacy in the Spanish-American War, his service as governor of Puerto Rico, or any other military involvement.  No, the statue shows the man in a very civilian suit - if it is the uniform of anything, it is the uniform of a Saddlebred horse rider, and celebrates him as an accomplished horseman whose history involves the founding of the American Saddlebred Horse Association.  Perhaps the marker could be re-worded to reflect his history in a more broad summation of his life's accomplishments post-Confederacy.  If it is determined that the statue has to come down, I am hopeful that the ASHA would help find a suitable place for it.  

As for a statue that is probably more worthy of removal, I would recommend the statue of Judge George Prentice, which sits in front of the Louisville Free Public Library.  As editor of the Louisville Daily Journal, precursor to the Courier-Journal, his editorials inflamed anti-immigrant sentiment and religious intolerance of the readership, and was decidedly a factor in the ""Bloody Monday"" riot of 1855.

That said, I very much fear that the ""art"" component is being disregarded in the discussion of ""public art.""  Sculpture is a meticulous and demanding art form, and whether or not one cares for the symbolism, one should be able to appreciate the craftsmanship and artistry involved in its creation.  Perhaps a historical sculpture garden could be established so that monuments deemed offensive could be moved before they are toppled by senseless mob vandalism; only people who wanted to see the sculptures would go, and it could serve as a teaching tool for students and history buffs of all ages.

Thank you for allowing this discussion."

40272,I have just cried over this
40204,"With respect specifically to the statue of General John Castleman: I believe that if this statue was of Castleman in Confederate uniform, removing it might be a valid consideration. But he is not in Military garb. He was a civic leader. The statue should remain. I find the statue of George D. Prentice in front of library much more questionable. Yet strangely, no one seems to have a problem with the man who instigated violence against the Catholic community (for which no one was brought to justice or prosecuted by our leaders.)

History is not black and white. No individual is perfect. 

Some will mention that Castleman was a Confederate and that he was for segregation. While that is true, it's also true that segregation (in housing) was the law in Louisville in the early 1900's. While that is unfortunate, as is the fact that the city was once a major center for slave trade, that is our history. The leaders of our city supported that viewpoint at the time just as they supported the urban renewal which destroyed the Russell neighborhood in the 1960s. Where does this cleansing of history end? So do we have a purity test for every monument, street name etc? 

Must we only honor perfect people or people that have offended no one? Are we going to change the name of Jefferson County next because Jefferson owned and abused slaves? 

Leave the Castleman statue alone."
40203,"I believe that it would greatly benefit our city and our community by removing all public works honoring those that supported the confederacy, fought for segregation, and/or made hateful, demeaning remarks about women and people of color. These are not people that deserve to be honored publicly in our great diverse city. "
40217,
40205,"I grew up just a couple blocks from Cherokee Park and the statue has always been there. This is the first time, that I can remember, there has been this much interest in taking the statue down. It's a common theme across the country sparked by the events in Charlottesviile, VA. I understand that phenomenon, and I think it's a good thing. We all must firmly agree that there is no place in this country for hate and violence towards anyone. It is good vs. evil, and good must prevail. My first thought was leave the statue right where it is. That piece of art, that symbol, does not really mean that much to me other than it has always been apart of the Cherokee Triangle. Cherokee Triangle would seem empty with out it. Without any overlay of historical context, the statue is a bronze sculpture. Add in historical context, and it becomes a sculpture of a Confederate officer who decided to fight for the Confederate Army, in a Civil War that was, in fact, above all else, fought over the right to keep slaves as property or to make them equal and free citizens of the United States. The civil war is the darkest era in the history of this country and that statue can be a reminder of that. Many people view that symbol differently and maybe the statue has evolved to be a symbol of Southern pride, or a symbol of Cherokee Triangle pride. Regardless, it has evolved once again to symbolize evil for so many over the past week because of evil people that are using these old symbols as symbols for their hate and malice towards other races and ethnic groups. Anyone offended by the symbolism of that statue has a right to contest its existence. They may be reminded of hate and malice every time they see it. I do understand how those emotions can be derived. I'm not angry at a statue though. I am angry at hateful people who base their prejudices on race, ethnic affiliation, or sexual orientation. I think there is value in the statue being a reminder of our nation's dark history. I can look at the statue and be reminded of that history, but I do not necessarily feel its dark history. I can also say there is value in removing the statue because for some, the removal would symbolize that Americans will not stand for hate. Whether the symbol stays or goes is not up to me. To me, the statue symbolizes a time in this country's past where Americans came together and defeated evil. It's not often that the losers get to convey that message, but this statue does. I believe it should stay.   "
40218,"Public art is a great thing,....except when it portrays bigotry, racism, or slavery or those who supported or participated in those things.  They should ALL go, in favor of public art that inspires the best in everyone!"
40505,"I cannot understand how and why our nation has so many monuments that honor and celebrate the Confederate Army and leadership.  Probably my lack of knowing of full context of post civil war sentiments and what it might have taken to heal and bring the country back together following the civil war.  In today's context I can certainly see how African Americans would be offended by these monuments, which honors people that fought to keep them enslaved.  Such esteem to those that fought to keep slavery bothers me a lot, so I can't imagine what our African American fellow citizens must feel like having these boastful monuments in prominent places throughout the south, as well as many places across the U.S. 

Following the war the Confederates we're forgiven as the nation came back together.  Some Confederates  even served for the U.S. military and some likely made great contributions to their communities and to our country reunited.  If we can find honor in these post civil war contributions, then let's show this in the plagues that go with their statues and let them remain in place."
40217,"Any statue honoring someone who is known primarily as a confederate/slave owner should go. This is intimidating to our citizens and only reaffirms the power of white people in our community. If we are truly interested and invested in parity, we should make the removal of the statues a priority."
40206,"I am not a person of color, but I'm very concerned about what art we use to decorate our city. Our monuments and our murals tell a story of who we are, and my Louisville doesn't glorify oppression. This is more than just someone being offended about a statue. This is about whether we are ready to acknowledge the sins of our father or continue to lie to ourselves in an effort to save our pride. We, as people of privilege who have the ability to make change, owe it to our brothers and sisters in Louisville to make the right decision and stop tolerating ignorance. This is a moment where we can show leadership in racial relations. Let's replace art with hope, and move towards a future together, regardless of race."
,"Cattleman fought for the Confederacy and segregated Cherokee park. He does not deserve to be honored. I urge you to remove his statute, along with all Confederate statues/art in the city!"
40206,"To Whom This May Concern,

As a life long resident of Kentucky, I am very much in support of the removal and relocation of public art that honors bigotry, racism, and/or slavery. For too long these Confederate monuments and statues have cast a dark shadow over Kentucky's citizens. The ghosts of Castleman and Jefferson Davis serve as oppressive reminders to marginalized groups that although America won the war, the confederate ideals of racism, bigotry, and division will remain forever.

Many in opposition state that it is a ""preservation of heritage"" and a ""reminder"" of mistakes past. However, take a look at Germany to see how they ""remind"" themselves of their mistakes of WWII. You don't see statues of fallen SS soldiers/generals but rather memorials of the millions of innocent lives that were taken by the nazi regime. Rather than erect statues of Castleman, we should erect a memorial in his stead of all the thousands of union soldiers that fought to protect our most inalienable rights as American citizens or a memorial for all the slaves he possessed and stripped of their humanity. We don't need reminders that slavery happened (thanks public education!). Rather, we need to uplift our city by erecting symbols of love, peace, and unity. 

Moreover, this ""preservation of heritage"" is a glorification of the confederate ideals who by definition are enemies of the state. If you look at the dates these statues were erected, you will see that they occurred during early 1900's as white supremacy re-surged in modern American society. Confederate monuments and memorials began popping up across the nation (mostly in the south), funded by white supremacist groups. These statues serve as reminder to marginalized groups that they are second class citizens and will never be equal to the white race. That level of fear conditioning is paramount and has very real consequences on an individual's mental health. A couple examples include increased sense of helplessness and hopelessness as well as being more likely to engage in self-medicating behaviors such as drug use.

Having obtained my Master's of Science degree in Clinical Psychology from the University of South Carolina and worked with abused and neglected children my entire career, I have seen first hand the damaging psychological effects that trauma has on the mind, body, and soul. These symbols of the confederacy must stop being glorified in our neighborhoods, parks, and legislative buildings where they will contribute to the continued systematic oppression of ethnic groups as well as embolden extremists.   

I implore the Louisville Commission of Public Art to tear down these monuments of hate. We cannot allow the mistakes of our past to further condition our brothers and sisters to believe that they are less than human. For we are not rewriting the past by removing such bigotry, but empowering future generations to stand up to racism.

Christina R. Miller"

40241,This is disgraceful. This so disrespectful to the descendants of the people who are honored. Who has the right to determine the validity of art. Just because someone or a group thinks works of art such as statues are racist.  The people who are represented by these statutes were courageous people.  They took a stand. Why are people today trying to say that is wrong.  We all take a stand on things.  That is what I am doing.

Racism is, unfortunately, still very much alive.  Slavery, like it or not, IS a part of our history.  The operative word being ""history"".  It is in the past and because ancestors might have partook in slavery, doesn't mean that it should be constantly brought up and people made to pay for the mistakes of our ancestors.  Racism and bigotry is nothing more than hate passed down from one generation to another and present day parents need to stop it NOW.  Stop blaming others for our own shortcomings, inadequacies or the fact that not all of us were born with a silver spoon in our mouths.  We are responsible for our own feelings.

47404,"I grew up in Louisville.  Both sides of my family were German immigrants who came to Louisville in the late 1880's.  I never comment on political controversies, but I feel compelled to offer my voice concerning the statue of John Breckinridge Castleman on his American Saddlebred horse Cherokee Triangle.  My father and grandfather grew up in the Highlands and used to take me to the fair there every year.  I used to like to see the ""horse statue"" because I was a horse-crazy little girl.  My grandfather and father indulged me and for me that area is special.  It holds an importance of place for me -- a touchstone to my childhood if you will.  I was saddened to see the images of it covered in orange paint.  It felt very personal for some reason I can't explain.  I hope a community dialogue will take place where all sides can voice their opinions respectfully without being labeled a racist nazi or a radical anarchist.  I am a democrat and believe in social justice, but I do hope the statue is not relocated.  That area would never be the same for me and lose something that made it unique.  Thank you."
40299,"You've been taking notes from the Taliban I see, these are not monuments to racism, or hate.  They honor brave men who fought and many who died for their beliefs.  They were soldiers, and some were great men who did much more than fight in a war between the states.  They have survived in some cases for over 5 generations.  What gives anyone the right to think that they should remove or destroy them.  Remember your choice when they come to remove the monuments that you hold dear.  "
40204,"It's time to remove the Castleman monument.

Monuments that honor the Confederacy and those that fought to preserve it also honor the way of life that the Confederacy stood for. They honor slavery and racism.

Confederate soldiers fought to destroy the ""indivisible"" union. To preserve slavery. Why in the world would we want to honor them?

Take down the Castleman monument and replace it with a true Louisville hero: Muhammad Ali!"
40205,"Opinion's are like butt holes everybody has one. That being said, just because something offends you does not give you the right to force your view on me. As to me as well. If you say a statue offends you and that is should be taken down, and I say it offends me that you want to take it down. How does your view trump mine?  Guess what it does not. This country needs to stop wearing their feelings on their sleeves. Nobody cared about them until a bunch of racists on both sides of the point had a fight.  2 weeks ago the problem was Russia,  do we hear anything about them now? No. So to make a long story short, leave all the stuff where it is at and learn from the past.  If we do not learn from the past we will end up repeating it.  "
40204,"I am concerned we will lose a historical context from which to learn from our past errors if we destroy monuments.
We will rob future citizens of the opportunity to learn about and from our past.  
Read the statements put out by the National Park service about the purpose of keeping monuments.
Perhaps if there are monuments that gratuitously glorify slavery and hatred then MAYBE relocate them but even then be very, very careful in making such a decision for the above stated reasons.
Wouldn't it be better to rewrite the plagues that accompany monuments?"
40204,"I am writing in support of keeping the Castleman statue. Images and symbols fall under the protection of the First Amendment, which is why some flags are protected and even pornography (minus child pornography). Porn is degrading to both sexes, as is racism, which is even worse, but I still uphold the First Amendment. If we chip away at that, we can potentially chip away at anything. The statue descends into a very dark part of America's past that we should be ashamed of; even though Castleman is in civilian clothing, he is symbolic of racism. However, if we get rid of the statue, what will be next? Rename Washington D.C. because George Washington held slaves? Rename so much more? Remove or vandalize Castleman's gravestone or even graves of Confederate soldiers? Would we go so far as to dishonor the dead and their descendents? What precedent would this set? Would a return to book burning be next? If images are in danger, so too are words. Who decides what is sacrificed to the pile? If the statue is removed , it is the ultimate visual of hate, with little regard to residents in the Highlands and others, even if its intent is to counter that. I don't want to live in a city that slashes historical art and the beautiful things we have left. Some have said just leave the horse, but without it being a particular horse and a talented one (esp. in Derby territory), that would be just silly, especially to tourists. Why can't my dog make the cut? Or my goat? Why can't we preserve the statue but erect another sign explaining why and that we as a city don't endorse what it's connected with but want to use it as a learning tool, discussing its negative implications and historical context? Why must we destroy? I hope we can all ponder the question: If this is removed, what will be next? "
40223,"Erect a statue of Frederick Douglass, former slave and abolitionist. He did not believe in dividing people by race. "
40258,"Stop. Do not remove. Louisville is turning into the city of,"" suck "". Louisville is starting to suck. "
40203,"Regarding the John B. Castleman monument in Cherokee Triangle: This work is not honoring him for his having been a part of the confederacy. This is a much beloved landmark in the area, loved by me as a child and loved by my children today. The condemnation of this statue by a small number of people should not demand it's removal. This is not a monument in any way to the confederacy! His work with the Louisville parks system, his work with the unified US army after civil war, and even his work with horses far outweigh his short work with the confederacy. I fully support the removal of ALL monuments to the confederacy but the Castleman statue IS NOT SUCH A WORK. 
PLEASE DO NOT take this wonderful work of public art away!"
40243,"Any decisions to remove any public art, statutes, memorials should be put on the ballot. Do not make our decisions for us.  Loud does not mean right. Rational thought and process should be the way.  Let us vote on it."
40242,The Castleman statue is not a Confederate military monument but a tribute to a man who was very influential in the development of Louisville. If the statue is removed where does it stop? Exhuming the Confederate dead in Cave Hill and removing the Thomas Jefferson statue from the front of Metro Hall?  The man was a product of his time and though we may not agree with some of his views it is dangerous to attempt to expunge history.
40203,"I am in favor of removing confederate statues and monuments in Louisville area.  Our mayor has called for the community to meet one another with understanding, empathy and acceptance. Removal of confederate monuments will be a step towards demonstrating these ideals. Please remove these statues and monuments, let's meet this issue with compassion. "
40220,"Removal of historical statues, monuments, and markers won't change attitudes and it won't change history. Are we going to start removing cemetery markers, closing historical homes, and other public/private art that doesn't appeal to every individual? Remembering history is what prevents us from making the same mistakes over and over again. Catering to small groups making noise isn't the answer. Personally, the statute of David in front of 21C offends me, but I'm not calling for it's removal. My protest is in not supporting the business that host the statue."
40202,"I recommend a case by case approach and not a categorical approach.  I ask first and fore most what is the person or group being honored FOR.  Is the person or group being honored primarily for treason, slavery or racism or something evil, or is the person or group being honored for something good, DESPITE not because of some other evil in their past.  Is the person or group shown in Confederate military uniform with or without weapons, does the person or group have significant ties to Louisville or even Kentucky, what are the views of the surviving family members if any, is the site a grave or burial site, was the site a battlefield during the Civil War or have some other great significance to the Civil War, would additional signage or information at site be helpful, are hate groups using the art to support or promote hate, if the art is to be moved - to where from where, would it advance knowledge and understanding if the art was placed in a museum along with similar art that provides a better balance or context of events, how do minority groups view the art and so on.  I use a multi-factor approach but at the end of the day the main question I always ask and try to answer is what primarily is the person or group being honored FOR.  Is evil being primarily honored, or is something good being primarily honored, DESPITE not because of some evil in that person's or group's past.  "
40220,"Mayor Fisher,

Your first term in office, you remained pretty moderate and did a good job. It seems lately that you are starting to go to the extreme left and not representing everyone. It seems like this administrationis trying to do what ever is done in Lexington. Louisville should not be following Lexington. I feel that  The Louisville Commission on Public Art is just another over reach of government. Government needs to stick to Public Safety, fixing the roads (which are not so great) and picking up the garbage.  There is plenty of public art in this town that offends me, but that is my problem, not everyone else's. Government needs to quit bowing down to the small amount of people that are making the most noise. Thank you for your consideration"
40205,"Moving the Castleman statue would be the political equivalent of what the German theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer once described as cheap grace. It would be an easy, costless way to feel good about ourselves by diminishing our collective memory of a man who committed the cardinal sin of failing to live by twenty-first century values. If we removed the statues of every president who did something to promote and perpetuate slavery or racial segregation, how many would be left? Will American society really be more enlightened if we forget all these people who came before us?"
40228,"The Castleman statue in Cherokee Park was intended to honor the man's contributions to the park system.  The fact that he once fought for the Confederacy is not the reason for the statue.  The statue is not dressed in a Confederate uniform.  If you take down the Castleman statue because he fought in the Confederacy, you might as well remove statues of Washington and Jefferson.  No human being is perfect.   We do not honor human beings for their flaws, and we do not define them by their imperfections.  We honor men and women because of their sacrifices and contributions to the good of humanity.  If that person had never lived, would our community, our world be poorer for his/her loss?  According to a BBC summary, ""the Prophet Muhammad did not try to abolish slavery, and bought, sold, captured, and owned slaves himself. Should we therefore blot out all references to Muhammad?  If a historical figure's main contribution to the world is to protect and defend the institutions of slavery, racism, or bigotry, then they should surely not be glorified in public parks or in front of public buildings, etc.  And if they are being glorified BECAUSE of their participation in such institutions, their monuments should be removed.  But, if like Castleman, they are not depicted in the act of transgression and are not being glorified for their imperfections, then let us continue to remember the improvements they made to the world.
"
40059,I would like to see all the statues of Civil War heroes removed.  There are too many people in the South who think the war never ended.  We need to do more to educate those people and let them know that bigotry and hate has no place in the South or in America. A museum dedicated to the Civil War could be an option.
40220,"I would like to see the George Prentice statue at the main library downtown removed. Just having a plaque saying he had a tainted history is not enough.
"
40272,Do not let a few people who are offended ditate what is right and what is wrong...Lets vote on it ..
40023,"I lived on Rosewood & on Glenmary for many years, & always thought of the Castleman statue as a nice piece of public art. Because I'm white-skinned, I could afford to be ignorant of its Jim Crow history. Those black folks Castleman barred from his park, & their children & grandchildren, could afford no such ignorance.  When I look at the statue through their eyes, I see a defiant white man on horseback who fought to keep my people enslaved, & when he lost that fight made Jim Crow laws to deny my people their freedom. I see other white men on horseback -- shades of those mounted police beating civil rights demonstrators in the 60s. This statue was erected to continue the subtle & not-so-subtle intimidation of black folks by white folks who couldn't let go of their belief in their white supremacy.

I look at the Castleman statue now & it turns my stomach. Take it down. Now. For the sake of all of our children & grandchildren. "
40206,"As a lifelong resident of Kentucky, there are a plethora of statues and pieces of public art around the state.  Each piece tells a story both good and bad and can be used for educational teaching moments.  While some pieces of art may not reflect good moments in time, people of all ages can learn what makes Louisville through historical figures and landmarks.  Please leave all the public art pieces in the city up so people from all around the world can see what our town is yesterday, today and the future.  "
40205,"We owned property in the Cherokee Triangle for over 45 years and were members of the Cherokee Triangle Assoc. part of that time.  We cherish the Association's protection of the history and heritage of the Triangle then and now!  So we are asking, no, begging, the Association to defend the Castleman Monument's place in that history.  It has stood for 100 years! It is important that the integrity of the area be protected!!!  Further, The Castleman Monument depicts and honors his work in co-founding the American Saddlebred  Horse Association as recently reported by the Courier-Journal.  The statue shows him dressed in civilian clothes, not military uniform, and his horse, Carolina, emulates an equestrian stance. We have seen this dress and stance at the World Championship Horse Show here.!"
40204,"When making important decisions, you rationally weigh the pros and cons of the issue.  Let’s take an objective look at both sides of the debate to remove The John B. Castleman Monument from Cherokee Triangle.

First, the rationale to remove it is that he served in the Confederate Army.  At the age of 19, in the year 1861, he joined the Confederates.  As a talented horseman, he became Captain of the “Second Kentucky Cavalry”.  In 1864, while attempting to free Confederate prisoners in Indiana, he was captured and sentenced to death for spying.  However, President Lincoln suspended his execution.  He was then imprisoned in solitary confinement from September 1864 until July 1865.  After Lincoln’s assassination, Castleman was banished from the United States until pardoned in 1866 by President Andrew Johnson. 

John Castleman did indeed commit crimes by serving in the Confederate Army, but he was appropriately punished (about 1 year in solitary confinement) and then was pardoned by two presidents for his crimes. 

Now, let’s review his positive attributes. Upon returning to the US, he settled in Louisville and obtained a law degree from the University of Louisville in 1868.  Here are some of his contributions to our city and state.

 • He established an insurance company in Louisville called the Royal Insurance Company.  Taken from the book “Memorial History of Louisville From Its First Settlement To The Year 1896” by J. Stoddard Johnston, “He fully succeeded in building up for this company an exceptionally large business perhaps the largest of any one company now in operation in the South. … General Castleman has a thoroughly organized force of assistants and clerks and is said to have the finest agency in the country. His office is a model of architectural elegance and is the best situated in the city. He occupies one half of the first floor of the Columbia Building and it is visited and admired by strangers from all parts of the world.”  In building up his company, Castleman provided respectable jobs for many Louisvillians. 

 • Also from the ‘Memorial History of Louisville…’, “In 1878, he reorganized the famous Louisville Legion one of the best if not the best of the local military bodies in the United States. He has been practically at the head of it and the conservator of its esprit du corps during all the years since.”  The Louisville Legion volunteered for service in the US Army during the Spanish-American War and invaded Puerto Rico. Castleman was promoted to brigadier general and served as military governor of that island. 

 • In 1892, Castleman founded the American Saddlebred Horse Association, making it the first single breed horse association in the United States. It was originally located in Louisville, Kentucky and all horses had to perform five gaits in order to be issued registration papers. Again from the ‘Memorial History of Louisville…’, “He was a superb horseman himself he has never failed attracting attention and offering a model of grace and elegance in equestrian performance wherever the mounted men of Kentucky have made an appearance whether among the thousands on Broadway New York or elsewhere in the country.”

 • In 1900, after Kentucky Governor William Goebel was shot, Castleman was, for the second time, appointed adjutant general of Kentucky and was instrumental in averting civil war in Kentucky in the fallout of the assassination.

 • In 1905, he was a key figure supporting Louisville's Fusionist Party, an anti-corruption political party. Although the Fusionists never won many elections, they eventually caused reform in Louisville's election system to come about.

 • In Louisville, he had great influence as Commissioner of the Board of Parks for over 25 years, during which time he helped establish Louisville's Olmsted Park system, which spurred development in various parts of Louisville and became one of the city's most prized possessions.

This last achievement of his is definitely one of the most relevant to his statue in Cherokee Triangle, where he officially greets people to the park with gallantry and poised decorum.

We live in a civil society where people are forgiven for their crimes and hopefully strive to redeem themselves.  I challenge you to find anyone who so dramatically turned themselves around and made so many very positive and significant contributions to our city. 

His statue is not a confederate statue depicting him in his youth as an armed Confederate rebel.  It is a statue honoring the great park system of Louisville, his significant contributions to the establishment of our park system and his supreme talent as a horsemen.  The statue is not just another statue of Robert E Lee or Jefferson Davis in a random location, it is a statue that pays reverence to a very important and key figure in the proud history of Louisville and the material and positive contributions he made to Louisville.

For the record, I personally find the beliefs of Neo-Nazis, KKK and other white supremacists absolutely repugnant.  I am also not a supporter of Donald Trump.  I support the removal of statues that are clearly dedicated to memorializing the Confederate Army.

However, The John B. Castleman Monument is not a Confederate statue.  He is in civilian clothes proudly riding his Saddlebred horse as an older gentleman who made many positive contributions to our city.  Let’s not get swept away with narrowly focused ideology and be blind to his historical importance to our city and his work to establish our wonderful park system.  Removing this beautiful statue only because he once served in the Confederate Army would be a mistake.  The significant and noteworthy contributions he made to Louisville far outweigh his crimes as a young Confederate soldier.

40204,"Thanks for this opportunity to discuss options for statues and other public art that might be interpreted as questionable at this time.  I live in Metro District 8 and I appreciate Brandon Coan's appeals to follow a prudent process in dealing with the Castleman Statue. I hope we can follow the model set by the removal of the Jefferson Davis Confederate statue from 3rd St., with was accomplished with community input.
   I live on Willow Ave. and my sentiments toward the Castleman Statue are different from some who don't see it daily or view it as a centerpiece of their neighborhood. I want to remove any relics of the Confederacy, but I do not equate Castleman's role to that of Generals Lee or Jackson, President Davis, or Justice Roger Taney. Castleman appears on the statue in civilian clothes, not a military uniform. This fact might offer a solution to the problem.
   I offer this idea, not entirely in jest. What if the statue could be removed for repair and retrofitted to show Frederick Law Olmsted, a slightly older contemporary of Castleman? There are Olmsted statues that show him on a horse similar to Castleman's. A new historical marker could rename the statue after the man who designed the park that it faces.  Hopefully, people will support ""the same horse, with a new rider.""

Thanks for reading my comment.

40118,"First:  God made everyone and everything.  People have a right to voice their opinions, but only if they are respectful and civil, to all.
Second:  We learn from History, hopefully.  Do not destroy statues or monuments, place them in museums, as they are art, too.  Those statues that stand for something positive, like the Castleman Statue, should remain.  Just change the plaque.
Third:  The uproar are from people who want attention, such as the young man who said, he didn't want slavery to represent our state.  That's plain Bull.  He's taking advantage of an opportunity, to be in the lime light.  The Castleman Statue is honoring a man, who had foresight to create parks in Louisville.  The Alt Right, unfortunately, contains too many members, looking for a fight.  And the media should never give them the publicity, they want.  Honestly, if a person thinks like the Alt Right, why are they in the USA.  They should go to other countries that appreciates their bigoted and prejudice attitudes.  Thank you for the opportunity to speak."
91711,"To Whom it May Concern, 

Hello, my name is Bryan Castleman. I am not politically motivated to write this, and I voted for a very unknown candidate in the last presidential election. I am a lover of liberty. I am a friend to all people, no matter was their ethnicity is, or ability, or age. I graduated with a BA in Art, and I have taken many art history classes, and I understand how people have emotional reactions to all sorts of public art. I love art, for the beauty of it. 

My thoughts may be jumbled but I am going to write from the heart, and off the top of my head. 

I saw a segment on the news where the mayor didn't know the name of the man seated on the horse offhand. That is okay, and maybe now we can learn about him a little, because he was important to some people at one point in time. I know that, because I have read the testimonials in the back of his autobiography published by the Courier-Journal. 

I've known about the statue of my cousin John Breckinridge Castleman for a few years now and I have heard about it, for many. The statue was a gateway for me to learn more about my family history. In that way the monument has served for historical purposes. Probably if there wasn't a monument, I wouldn't have read his book entitled Active Service written by the man on the horse. My cousin was a gifted writer, and he could paint with words the scenes from his childhood. 

In the book, there are descriptions of the initial reasons why the statue was erected. There are articles from newspapers, and letters from townspeople. There are records of the towns generosity to donate toward the work. 

To view it in a solely Confederate context is wrong and I don't think that is how it was unveiled. He was a civil servant. He was ""a friend"" of many according to the Mayor at that time. He was instrumental in preventing war in the state of Kentucky, after Gov. William Goebel was shot. He was also known for his love of horses from the time he was a child. He founded the American Saddlebred Horse Association and was its president. He also won a competition on his mare at the Chicago Columbian Exposition World's Fair. 

I believe he even donated a lot of land to the public park system. According to The Kentucky Encyclopedia he founded The Louisville Park Department and was made park commissioner. 

To view a older white person with a beard, sitting upon a horse, from the 1900s may evoke strong emotions. However, this is the way John B. Castleman was often seen in town as he rode his five-gaited mare. 

Did you know that people at one time pelted Michaelangelo's statue of David with stones? Did you know that one time during a anti-Medici riot the arm was broken into three pieces? Such a beautiful statue that we admire today was one time seen as a political statue. I am glad it survived. 

The John B Castleman statue was modeled after photographs of him as an older man, in normal clothing. John B. Castleman was 24 years old when the Civil War ended and he received a pardon from the President of the United States for his actions. The definition of pardon is forgiveness, and I wish that people could embrace it now for the many people that were pardoned for their actions during the Civil War. We united and became one country. 

The location of the statue is fitting for the context of his public service. He labored 8 hours a day for many years on behalf of the city. At the statue's unveiling many people were there, children and friends, and musicians. 

I know some things are often banned, like books that challenge us. I know that Mark Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn has been banned in places and at times. Many books that have shaped America have been banned at times for reading because they challenge us. It may be hard on the ears to read Mark Twain's use of dialects that sound racist today, to capture his characters. But he is painting a picture for us with words about a time period. 

To say the unveiling and creation of the monument was for White Supremacist reasons, with no evidence is absolutely wrong, and it is a revisionist theory unless it is proven otherwise by statements during the time it was fashioned. 

There are monuments to other men like FDR, who may evoke strong emotions in Japanese people, and yet, his monuments are not on the chopping block because people are celebrating the good, and not the bad. There are many things Lincoln said and believed, that would be misunderstood if we didn't challenge ourselves to understand the historical contexts and the difficulties of repairing the evil institution of slavery. 

Aesthetically speaking, the statue is beautiful if we are not thinking of the person who it depicts. As a work of art, it is a fine piece. 

My cousin, John Breckinridge helped get Grover Cleveland, a conservative Democrat elected president. Grover Cleveland's classical liberalism, is nothing like a Nazi. 

To let fringe groups cause emotional stirs with these violent protests and clashes against each other, has nothing to do with the original intent of this statue. 

When Socialists activists (such as Socialist Action), or Black Lives Matter organizations or sympathizers come to protest this statue, are they doing so with the goal of being intellectually honest about the historicity of this monument? I saw many people researching my cousin in order to justify their positions that the statue must go. 

I myself am against fascism, and believe that black lives matter. I live in the real world. But that doesn't mean I am an Antifa, Black Lives Matter supporter that is on MTV's The Real World. Unfortunately I think confusion is being caused by equivocation. 

I think average people in this country are able to confront, and understand, the true history of our country, whether it is good or bad. We must not use a large brush to condemn large groups of people, and call them sympathizers of radical ideas. 

I really hope the monument stays, and is re-contextualized with new signage, for what it is. I really don't believe it was created to honor his action during the Civil War first and foremost. The records of the day, do not tell me that, and I highly encourage anyone to read the book before you yield to emotional public pressure. 

Many of my Castleman cousins whom I met online across the country also have been proud to know that we had a cousin, that was honored at one time, and he stood there for many years. We see this statue in a personal way. I know it is easy to view history from the viewpoint of government, but when you read the letters of people during the Civil War, you see Northern soldier's in Custer's command helping wounded Southerners. My Virginian cousins helped the wounded. My 3rd Great Grandfather had children who fought on both sides of the War. 

As a genealogist, I always try to be honest with myself and try to learn the facts whatever they are. I don't want to glorify or idealize the past. 

To be honest, I wish our country wouldn't have ever taken down the statue of King George after the revolution either. Today it would stand as a reminder of why we seceded from Great Britain, and declared our Independence. 

I really can't know my own cousin any better than someone else who tries their hardest to know the man by what facts are left behind. I do believe that he had love for the people whom his own family held as slaves. As he wrote one of them came from Peter Jefferson, and even waited on Thomas Jefferson. 

I believe he loved them, and I believe when he attended the funeral of Isaac Byrd, and then buried him like family in his own family's plot, he was acting in love and friendship. Mind you, this was 40 years after the Civil War in the early 1900s. Do people know that fact? I don't think they do. I think there is a motivation to frame him, in a way, that is negative. 

He may have been able to do things better in terms of healing and repairing the past. But like all of our politicians, and ancestors of that era, we have to take the context of the situation into consideration. 

Isn't our entire country trying to heal the past, and so many of us want to repair it, and it never seems to heal. 

Let me provide an example of another situation in my Castleman family history: 

In 1860, just prior to the outbreak of the Civil War, 
Mary Morrison (Lee) Castleman wrote:
“His [Rev. Castleman] mother just died in Virginia and left him, six slaves. He cannot conscientiously set them free; for he cannot tell what would become of them. He cannot send them to Liberia; he has not the means. He cannot bring them here [Harrisburg, PA] in the existing state of feeling on the subject. His conclusion is, he must go back to Virginia, take a country parish and take care of these slaves.” 
---
The years during and immediately after the Civil War were difficult for this large family. Practically destitute, they were loaned a small farm which allowed them to feed their family. Both Mary and her husband sought out teaching jobs.
in 1865, Rev. Castleman was inexplicably shot and killed by an unknown person while returning home from a neighbor’s house. His obituary noted, “He had no enemy, capable of such a deed; it is supposed he was the victim of an appalling mistake.”
His obituary reads: ""An affectionate husband and devoted father, a faithful pastor, and preacher of Christ and Him crucified.""
Some context 
On Feb 27, 1860, Abraham Lincoln said he favored ""deportation"". In 1862, when Congress ended slavery in the District of Columbia they set aside $600,000 for freed slaves to be deported. Lincoln's Commissioner of Emigration planned to send people to a list of countries that were not even their native lands such as Equador, Honduras, French Guiana, etc.


Well, if this letter doesn't help to explain my feelings on the matter I don't know what would. 

I will suffer no loss if the statue comes down, and I don't believe we will gain much either. 

Thank you for your time. 

Sincerely, 

Bryan Castleman

40207,"I think that any statue that is offensive to any one particular race should come down if people from that race want it to come down. White people, especially neighborhoods of affluent white people, should not have a say in this. I'm white and I live in an affluent neighborhood and we in this neighborhood are overwhelmingly ignorant and small-minded and shouldn't be allowed to make or influence these decisions. Leave it up to people of color. "
40205,"I strongly believe that the removal of the Castleman Monument would be a terrible mistake.  First of all, removing statues is divisive and creates animosity and divides our community. What are we achieving?  It would cause all those who greatly appreciate this beloved icon of Louisville to be angry at others simply to satisfy the whims of a minority of activists with blinders on.  It would cause more hatred in our community, not less.  

Secondly, this isn't a monument to the confederates or to the civil war.  It's a monument to the man who founded Louisville's park system. And, he founded the Saddlebred horse organization, which is a horse breed from the United States that started here in Louisville! He is dressed in civilian clothes proudly riding his favorite horse. Other than the plaques, there is nothing about the statue that lionizes the confederate rebels. If we do anything, we should change the plaques to highlight the achievements he made here in Louisville, and remove any mention of the civil war. 

There are far better ways to support racial justice in more appropriate and realistic ways like economic development and education and human resource and physical resource infrastructure development. These are the real existential threats to racial justice.

I urge you to leave this beautiful statue right where it is and where it belongs, greeting people to Cherokee Park.

Thank you.

40205,"I don’t like it when works of art are banned or destroyed. Having said that, I do understand that not all art works are ars gratia artis. Sometimes political propaganda are disguised as works of art - the Nazis and the Soviets were, of course, this strategy’s most infamous practitioners. I generally don’t have a problem with these propaganda tools disguised as art being removed from public view, as their purpose wasn’t artistic but something more sinister. An example from film is a favorite movie of mine called “Goodbye, Lenin,” which takes place in East Berlin at the time of the fall of the Wall. The title scene shows a helicopter taking away the statue of Lenin put there by the occupying Soviets, a symbol of their control over the East Germans. Again, I’m fine with that.
Accordingly, I’m fine with the removal of the propaganda tools disguised as art used by the Jim Crow-era politicians. It has been well documented that a well-coordinated and effective strategy was implemented after Reconstruction in the South to sanitize the memory of the Southern “Lost Cause” and foster a hero-worship campaign of those who fought for it. The erection of those monuments and statues also served the purpose of reminding the African American population of the terror white supremacists could bring to bear upon them if they chose, now that the Federal troops had left for good. So I would equate removing the old Confederate Monument near UofL and the Jefferson Davis statue in the Kentucky Capitol with the removal of statues of Lenin and Stalin in former Warsaw Pact countries. They were all installed there as symbols of oppression and need to go.
Which brings me to the Castleman Statue.
To repeat: I don’t like it when works of art are banned or destroyed. There has to be a really, really, REALLY good reason for doing so, like its front as political propaganda or as a symbol of oppression.  The Castleman Statue is neither. In essence, it’s a statue of the long-time president of the American Saddle-Bred Breeder’s Association, probably the thing John B. Castleman was most proud of in his life. Castleman is depicted wearing fin de siècle riding clothes, and he’s atop his beloved show horse Carolina (if you’ve ever gone down Carolina Ave near Cherokee Park, that’s who it’s named after.) Carolina is prancing as she would have in a dressage competition. If this statue was part of the Jim Crow “Lost Cause” strategy, then Castleman would have been depicted in an unmistakable Confederate uniform, wearing (or perhaps brandishing) a sword, and Carolina would have been a war horse in full gallop. Also, in order to achieve maximum effect, the statue would have been placed where a lot of people could see it, like smack in the middle of Third St, as the Confederate Monument was. When the Castleman Statue was erected in 1917, they decided to put it on a side street in what was then a laconic streetcar suburb. If this statue was intended to be part of the “Lost Cause” plan, those in charge of its implementation couldn’t have done a worse job if they tried. Yes – because they didn’t try. That’s not what this is.
In the century since this statue was unveiled it has become a Highlands landmark. No doubt for the first few decades it reminded Highlanders of John B. Castleman. Over the course of time, as those who knew him or heard of him secondhand died off, the statue is likely better known as “The Guy on the Horse.” Countless numbers of people have driven by this statue without knowing or caring anything about the subject. Unless you makes a point of stopping to read the plaques or do online research you’d never know the subject was in the Confederate army, the United States army, neither, or both. And if you only just read the plaque on the pedestal you’d leave misinformed – the plaque says he was a major general in the CSA, but actually he was only a major.
This is not a Confederate Monument. It is not propaganda for the “Lost Cause.” It’s an attractive, even beloved statue of a guy on a horse. It should stay right where it is.
"
91711,"“I recognize that some people say all these monuments should be left alone, because they are part of our history,” Fischer said. “But we need to discuss and interpret our history from multiple perspectives and from different viewpoints. That’s why a community conversation is crucial.”

I can't help but notice the Black Lives Matters organization showing up to protest the equestrian statue of John B. Castleman. I would like to say that I believe black lives matter. I am able to recognize the ideology apart from the official organization. I believe in many instances leaders of the organization seem to perpetuate the racism that we need to leave in the past. We cannot look at each other in ignorance of our individual past. A color scheme ignores the variety of different heritages of ""white"" people. 

My wife's family came to the United States from Poland, escaping the wicked regime of Hitler. 

One of the co-founders of Black Lives Matters in Louisville, KY, is Chanelle Helm who proudly speaks her point of view. I would like it to be read, so that we can understand the ""multiple perspectives"" as the Mayor intends.  

She writes: 

""White people, if you’re inheriting property you intend to sell upon acceptance, give it to a black or brown family. You’re bound to make that money in some other white privileged way.""

""White people, re-budget your monthly so you can donate to black funds for land purchasing.""

I write to you as a person who is 42 years old who has a net worth of about -$60,000. I am an not saddled on a horse, but I am saddled in debt, with four children. I'm an apartment manager, and we barely get by in California in a 2 bedroom apartment. I have a Bachelor's Degree and I recently took classes at UCLA Extension to try to help my family. 

When someone looks at me purely by the shade of my skin, and judges me, it bothers me in the same way, it does others. 

I stand proudly together with the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. when he said, ""I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character. 


Will the removal of this statue pacify anyone in the long term? 
Are we honoring the community's original intent for the monument? Why isn't the real history of the monument written next to it? Why was it contextualized as a Confederate monument? 

Will the removal of this statue bring us closer together? 

Will it heal the current problems? 

Has the actual history of the monument been considered? Has this monument become a football in the current political and culture war? 

Who are the people acting as the historical revisionists in this debate? 

Who are the moral relativists? Who are the relativists here? Does the original purpose matter? 

"
40207,"All monuments dedicated to those perpetuating slavery and injustice must be removed. If it is important to our community to preserve this history then we should commemorate the victims of these injustices, not the perpetrators."
40212,Leave the statues alone. It serves no purpose to remove any one of them. If you remove one you have to remove every single one no matter what it represents.
40207,We were discussing this the other night and a friend made a point I thought was interesting.  Are the Jews in Germany tearing down the concentration camps ?  Are the Egyptians tearing down the pyramids.  Are the English tearing down Stonehenge-I'm sure all of these represent some sort of slave labor who built these properties and horrific things that happened at each one.  They said we should remember our past lest we forget and repeat it.  Put up a plaque explaining what these men did and how they affected the minority population that is offended.
40245,"Louisville has a statue of Louis XVI.  It is prominently displayed on the grounds of the courthouse, across from City Hall.  King Louis ruled a country that had a detailed legislative scheme governing the slave population of its many colonies, including Haiti and the rest of the West Indies, and even Louisiana, which the United States Did not acquire until 1803. As ruling monarch, one could say that King Louis owned slaves.  He certainly did nothing to end the Black Code, or to end the practice of slavery.  One must assume that he was a racist as well. 

The statue of Louis XVI surely can be interpreted as honoring Bigotry, racism and/or slavery.  In fact, the city of Louisville's very name surely can be seen in that light.  If the Castleman statue is to be removed -- and it plainly should not be -- then it would be the apotheosis of hypocrisy to allow the statue of Louis XVI to remain.  As well, it would be impossible to allow the city to continue to be called Louisville. 
"
40220,"The Statue of George Prentice located to face the Louisville Free Public Library is a daily reminder of Mr. Prentice's influence to effect the Bloody Monday riots (1855) which culminated with the murder of 22 Irish and German Catholic residents of Louisville.   It should be removed, and if possible, destroyed."
40205,"As a silent observor of the Sat., Aug. 19 protest, I was surprised that there were only about two African Americans there, out of about 20 people. I was sitting right next to them in the playground when they were organizing. One source reported 20 and another 40 present. Twenty is more accurate. At 2:00, when they were supposed to organize for talking points rather predictable -- work in pairs, practice the script -- there were only literally around 8 people there. Really, how much do they care for their cause if they can't show up on time? I assumed they would have offered African Americans a means to be transported in, but apparently this wasn't the case. Therefore, this seems to be metaphorical racism/slavery where once again white people are being the voice for African Americans. Very disappointing. I assume they really don't care about the people apparently they represent."
America,"RE: John Castleman statue. That guy was a dick who fought America and used human beings as farm equipment. Put that narcissistic, racist lawn ornament in Cherokee Park or Cave Hill Cemetery. "
,"There's a sign... at 2nd and Main street ""Slave Trading in Louisville""  ....I don't even know how you haven't taken this sign down ...it literally says ... ""By the 1850s, Kentucky was annually exporting between 2500 and 4000 of its slaves down river to the large plantations farther south.  To prevent runaways, traders operating near the Ohio River kept slaves shackled together in pens when not being displayed to buyers.  Slave traders were often social outcasts avoided by all but fellow traders.""  Is this even POSSIBLY still a sign in this state...in this country???? How in the world can a state allow something that deplorable to even be allowed to exist???  I would literally say this state is on the side of the neo nazis that were in Charlottesville from seeing this and not caring to do anything about it.  Do you even actually care to take things that are obviously ...so OBVIOUSLY honoring racism...down..?  This is befuddling.  This is outrageous.  I have lived here most of my life and mostly lived in the east end of Louisville off Westport Road.  But this...regardless to what color you are is DISGUSTING.  It is absolutely fucking grotesque.  How can this state even pretend to be some part of the times as a progressive nation have something so terrible be in an area that has ....OBVIOUSLY a lot of people of color?  You realize that if this state doesn't take the offense that people of color have seriously, eventually, someone or some group will take it upon themselves to remove that sign??  It would probably save your government budget some money anyway.  And the sad thing is the KKK is trying to hold revival celebrations to burn crosses in Georgia ...yet here...we may as well be doing that already.  That sign is a burning cross that is a constant fire that people have to see everyday.  People that contribute to this state...people that visit this state...people that helped form this state.  This is an atrocity.  I can't believe you even have to ASK people to tell you what to take down ...you LIVE in this state...you KNOW where these things are....does it even really matter...at all...to any of you????  I am appalled ....and legitimately disappointed.  If this sign isn't taken down, I am going to take it to a higher place in government.  Obviously not the racist president that we have...but it cannot stand that this can just be allowed.  Why should this sign have even been created?  Why would you want this to somehow be celebrated....this sounds like some excerpt from a childhood tale ...and its just unbelievably shocking.  I'm ...in awe.  I really hope this is taken down as soon as possible..

A concerned citizen of this city"
40272," Here is how I stand on the issue. After much thought I have changed my mind on weather these monuments should be removed. Originally, I felt that it was wrong to remove them due to their historical value, but now, I believe that all of these monuments commemorating the institutional racism of the Democratic Party should definitely come down. Plus, I feel it is only right and just, that any Democrat serving in an elected position today apologize to the American people for their Party's role regarding slavery and it's aftermath. This includes our current Mayor and Democratic members of the Metro Counsel.

 Every single one of these Icons of the confederacy was a Democrat before and after the war. In 1860, there was not one Republican slave owner. The Democratic Party built these monuments and they own it. Take them down and take responsibility!!!! "
40207,"Please remove all confederate monuments from the city. The time to do this was years ago, and it's more than a little embarrassing that we didn't do it then. Not removing them after the last couple of weeks is missing a huge opportunity to get this obvious thing done."
40245,"These statues were erected for the many works of this man, slavery was not one of them. Doing so was reviewed and voted upon by the committee at that time, and made even though we can be assured they were well aware of his slave ownership in the past, yet his good deeds outweighed his bad. Do Not remove this statue or it will be only the beginning, next we will have to rename streets as well!!!"
40205,"As a long-time resident of Cherokee Triangle and the Highlands, I hope the community can come together to support the preservation of the Castleman statue. I respect the desire of those offended by Confederate Era memorials for their removal, but Castleman represents, in my opinion, a more complicated image of Louisville. Given the Triangle's history of preservation and support for the arts, maybe we can come together as a community to find a way to preserve the old and give it new context. New signage reflecting Castleman's complete story, and a new statue at the other end of Cherokee Parkway near the park, also bronze and maybe also on horseback, of a person or persons representing the forward progress of Louisville's humanity, as one people."
40241,I'm trying to explain to my son why we have statues to remember people who made bad choices because they thought that white people are better than black people.  Let's work to not make that a conversation that we need to have.  
40205,"I strongly support the removal of any public art which honors historic figures/events related to bigotry, racism and slavery. Public art puts forward those whose example we are invited to emulate. Let it be a collection of art celebrating heroes of peacemaking, anti-racism, creative movement toward a better world."
40204,"Mayor Fisher,
Please listen to the eloquent and passionate pleas from the community-at-large, not just the Highlands and Cherokee Triangle, to save the Castleman and Carolina statue. Please do not allow the misconstrued messages from protestors bring about the demise of this beloved and iconic statue. But for a few, this community has only recognized the monument as one dedicated to the city's Cherokee Park and its boulevard. As one individual, who lives outside the Highlands, questioned ""before the vandalism occurred, how many of those now in opposition even knew the statue existed."" I have lived in this neighborhood over thirty years and this is the first time I have heard such complaints as are being put forth today. If action has to be taken, then remove the bronze plaque if there are those that find its wording offensive. Please let the Castleman statue remain. I sincerely hope that a member of your staff is reading the many messages left on Next Door app; the heartfelt pleas to let this statue remain.

40059,"The Castleman Statue will most likely be the hardest to deal with. It is above average in its execution and it's subject had a varied career including honorable service attaining one of the highest ranks in the US military. Aesthetically, it is beautifully placed.

Since it is not a military depiction, it might possibly be reinterpreted.  As a beautiful depiction of a Saddle Bred horse, it is part if our equestrian heritage. Possibly the head of the Castleman  could be redone or a hat added that obscures the factual features. Ed  Hamilton should be consulted on the possibility. Then Castlemen's direct association can be lost and the connection of the Saddle Bred horse to Louisville can be added. 

the horse is really outstanding. Might request a donation from Wm. Schaftner.

40205,Please move the offensive statues to a museum where there are artfacts from slavery days.  This will show how awful it was that people actually fought to own another human being.
40204,"I am in favor of taking down Confederate statues.  Perhaps they can be placed in museums or in Confederate cemeteries.  I live in the Highlands neighborhood and I have always liked the Castleman statue, particularly at Christmas time when a holiday wreath is placed on the horse.  However, now that I know more about the history of Castleman, I think the statue should come down.  It is probably not possible, but I'd love if the horse alone could stay.  :)

Thank you for considering this issue.  We should all be more aware of the historical significance of these monuments in public spaces.  Just because we don't mean for them to be offensive, we need to recognize how others have a different perspective.  Public art should benefit the public--all of the public--not just white people."

40229,leave our monuments alone. they are our history. absolutely nothing has been said for years. why now?
40205,"Times change when people grow. Confederate statues should not be public memorials on public property. To remain is to not only condone the values of the Confederacy, but to display them for praise.  They are beautiful works of art and shouldn't be destroyed but rather moved to appropriate private locations or cemeteries for soldiers. No large collection to encourage their being sites of celebration by hate groups. Most large cemeteries are locked at night to protect them the sites and would discourage the most hate-filled gatherings by negative groups, preserves art and history, but doesn't support implied values associated with them.   A little history, many of these were erected during the 'Jim Crow' period to remind ex-slaves of 'their place' as well as well as to glorify the defeated rebels. Please consider moving them, then later the spot can be used for art representing shared American values. Remember, a wronged and important part of our population had no voice when these were erected. "
40205,"I am strongly in favor of removing all pieces of public art that can be interpreted to be honoring bigotry, racism and/or slavery, particularly those that honor Confederate leaders.  The vast majority of these pieces have their origins in efforts to physically and culturally enforce white supremacy in response to civil rights advocacy.  "
40241,"Pretending that this is a matter of aesthetics or history is disingenuous. This is a statue of a racist traitor that he had erected in his own ""honor.""

40203,"I have always appreciated that Louisville owns its history, good and bad, with its historical markers indicating significant happenings of the past. However that is different than honoring people and ideas with statues in public spaces. I was relieved when the confederate soldier memorial came down at U of L because it was not welcoming to or representative of so many of our students and residents. I hope the public art review will consider what these statues say about us, not just the city we were but the city we want to be going forward, and remove the statues that honor and celebrate people whose primary accomplishments were oppressive and bigoted. "
40205,"I support statues for redemption:
Black Louisvillian William Glass was visiting his hometown after being newly commissioned at the black officers training camp at Fort Des Moines. Walking down the street with his wife, he took offense when two white non-commissioned officers saluted a white officer but one of them refused to salute Glass saying ""I don't salute a Negro."" Before this incident Glass had always been saluted appropriately.
To ameliorate the situation, the venerable General John Breckenridge Castleman spoke out. A former Confederate major and commander of the famous ""Louisville Legion"" during the Spanish-American war, Castleman asserted that army discipline had to be maintained, which required the proper saluting of officers ""without regard to the color of their skin."""
40220,Leave our statues/history alone. 
91711,"In 1918, The Wisconsin State Journal wrote John B. Castleman ""was opposed to the institution of slavery but he was a hot-headed advocate of the principle of state's rights and to him every state was a republic unto itself.""

""In the days of his youth on his return from exile he, like General Gordon of Georgia, became a great reconstructionist. He went among the people of the south, telling them what the flag meant, how wrong their war was, how the lost cause was a wrong cause, how they should rejoice in their defeat tho never losing their love and enthusiasm for their hero dead who gave their valor for that which they thought to be right but which they now found, to their sorrow and to their gladness, was wrong. He was the sympathetic southerner who loved the South so much that he could love North and South more.

At the Lincoln Memorial in Hodgensille, John Breckinridge expressed his emotions, “I cannot describe my feelings. Here from a home of lower birth than that which I knew, the humblest hut of a cabin, came a man who lived to have the power to save my life. Had Lincoln lived, I always knew that I would have returned from exile not two years after but at the close of the war. In giving me my life this man gave me the light to see the wrong cause I had championed, the right cause that he battled for. I have given my life in a humble effort to carry on his work, to bring his divided people once more,”
General Castleman lived the repentance of a mistake against a just cause and a flag that was borne into battle for liberty and for a government that stood for both freedom and fellowship.

Albert Lea Evening Tribune
Thursday, November 22, 1917, Albert Lea, Minnesota

DRAWING COLOR LINE.
The question as to whether a white man must salute a colored officer in Uncle Sam's army is causing considerable trouble in many of the training camps. Many white officers, especially southerners have absolutely refused to recognize a colored officer.
Gen. John B. Castleman of Kentucky says:
""I unhesitatingly say that I will at any time salute an officer, superior or inferior, who salutes me, without regard to the color of his skin. The regulations and laws, and the fundamentals of courtesy and discipline, upon which these regulations and laws are based, prescribe this. It is no time to stand against them. I want to urge every soldier to be a soldier in the full sense of the
term. We are at war, and soldiers are under the rules of the American army. We are all one under the flag. We salute the rank, not the individual.""
General Castleman's stand in this matter seems to be right. It isn't the man that he salutes, but what he stands for."
40205,Please do NOT remove General Castleman!    
40220,"In general, I know that this effort is generated by the recent events in Charlottesville.  In particular, the issue is with civil war figures.  

Art and public displays will always offend someone.  Some art offends people of religion, other offends those of race, other of sexuality.  If a form of art was put up with the whole purpose to offend someone (i.e. a statue of the founder of the KKK in an African American neighborhood, A swastika in a Jewish neighborhood, we know that has an intent to offend.)  Most art and shrines are there to recognize history and culture and often celebrate flawed individuals.  

In our city we have several monuments that could be considered offensive to some:  Louis the 16 downtown was a horrible, oppressive, and unqualified French King, George Clark who lead expeditions into the West that resulted in great pain and suffering of ""First Nation"" people, monuments to WWII that was also a war that sent over 100000 people of Japanese decent into internment camps, monuments to police and fire (where we know the police created several issues for people of color during the civil rights movement), a statue of Wendell Ford in the airport that is a known racist, the list goes on and on.  John F Kennedy was a flawed man, adulterer, that we have a bridge named after.    

When we erect a statue of a person, we do so to tell about the history of the city or its people with all their flaws.  We recently named 34st after a minister that has a sorted past.    

We can ethnically cleansed and politicize our art out of recent hysteria or we can learn from our past and use it help us be better people.  

If you plan to cleanse our art and statues of the past out of some cultural hysteria, then you must do it everywhere to everything that can offend anyone and not just one group of people or event in time."
40299-7011,I wish evetyone wpukd get iver the statue debate. It is part of history. If they wish to delete history and get rid of statues then lets get rid of all of them.

By remembering our past mistakes, we can look to the future with better ideals."
40152,I lied in Louisville till I was 17 but sinces moved away. I believe that those statues should be removed and placed in nation cemetery or any willing to take on what may come to follow. Other options would be to move them to military bases or build a protected park  to place them in then a honorable way.

I do NOT want the CASTLEMAN statue to be removed. 

This statue was erected during Castleman's lifetime to honor his work with the American Saddlebred Association and various other civic causes. He is not in a military 
Uniform.   

He was in his twenties during the Civil War, a young man highly influenced and possibly still under the control of his family.  Once enlisted he had to follow orders and meet expectations.  He obviously was a person rich in the desire to succeed and accomplish goals. Louisville benefited and continues to benefit from his civic work. "

We are not supposed to infringe our beliefs of keeping history no more then the protestors should be allowed to infringe their beliefs of racism on us. Best solution is let them put up some statues. Now whether we let them put up statues or take down the statues. The protestors should raise the money for either decision that is made. If they want it bad enough they will get the money together.

The question is whether these pieces ACTUALLY honor bigotry, racism, and/or slavery, or whether some only INTERPRET these pieces as such. Was the statue of John Castleman erected to honor his participation in the Confederate Army, or was it erected to honor his service to the city?

In 1913, when the statue was erected, certain egregious laws were in place, a dismal hangover from the institution of slavery. Louisville participated in these laws, as did most every city in the US. Many people -- both white and black -- who lived during that time supported and upheld the laws, even if it was only to get along with life in the absence of great leaders and examples such as Martin Luther King, Jr, Muhammad Ali, or Jackie Robinson. Artists who lived and worked in Louisville may have supported and upheld those laws. Politicians of the time that we honor today as early fathers of the city may have supported and upheld those laws. 

It is a sad truth, but many of our American heroes, who struggled for many of the privileges we enjoy today, were tragically flawed. Indeed, many were racist. Susan B. Anthony, Thomas Jefferson, even Abraham Lincoln were known racists. Martin Luther King, Jr. was a known philanderer, plagiarist, and communist sympathizer. Do we endorse Thomas Jefferson's racism when we read his Declaration of Independence? Do we honor adultery when we name our highways and observe a national holiday honoring Dr. King? Indeed, racism is so finely interwoven in our nation's history that we could never extract the thread of it without entirely rewriting our history and rending the fabric of our collective identity. It is a hard truth, a sad truth, but it is a truth. 

I prefer not to whitewash our city's history in the hopes of eradicating its flaws. We honor Castleman with the monument for how he served our city, not for how he served an abhorrent system of bondage. Less dramatic measures than removal may be taken to amend the monument to better inform residents and visitors of Castleman's precise place in Louisville's history. In stating my position, do I reveal myself a racist? Surely, anyone wielding an ounce of logic could determine otherwise. Likewise, I hope cooler heads prevail in coming forum considering public art in our city. "
40229,Mayor Fisher you need to leave the Ark in Louisville the way it is Worry about his bike Lanes and the blacks in the West End Maybe furnish them free TV or something
40165,"All of the confederate statues should remain where they are; because they are the ones whom have made our country what it is today. They and our ancestors, fore fathers ect. Fought for our country. These statues were here long before ANYONE who is demanding for their removal now. I believe if people have a problem with them they don't belong in the USA. THIS IS OUR HISTORY, and they are acting like babies THAT DO NOT HAVE THEIR WAY. 

I AM ASHAMED OF THE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO CHANGE OUR HISTORY!!!"
40291,"Leave these monuments alone, they are part of history and should be left to remind us of that. I see these as a reminder that we have the right to rebel against the government and that the states have rights to do so and secede. Not that they represent slavery and/or condone it. The concept of slavery is moraly wrong in form. Memorials to the men that fought for a cause, right or wrong, should be left to remember them for that right."
40222, leave the statues as they are protected Civil War veterans monuments and tombstones they are protected in the year 1958 Congress pass the bill stating that all Civil War veterans are to be included as War veterans of the United States what's next are you going to burn books to don't bow down to these communists fascist paid protesters
40207,"if statues, such as General Castleman, are interpreted as honoring bigotry, then we should consider removing the plaque that names/honors Castleman.  This is catamount to removing a name from a trophy.  We risk a slippery slope of removing public art because of various offensive interpretations of the day.  I'm confident that if we allow this to continue, we will next turn our eyes to Daniel Boone, who was not to kind to the American Indian.  And also Thomas Jefferson, who is our county's namesake and has a statue at our Courthouse.  "
40204,"The statue to Castleman in the Cherokee Area was not put there to honor racism. This has been brought on by the fake-news. He was a general in the US army and fought in such wars as the Spanish American War with the Louisville League. He startred the American Saddle Horse Association (that is why he is sitting on his beloved horse, Caroline). Please notice that he is wearing riding clothes-not a military uniform. He was the Father of the Louisville Parks System and a great friend of Olmstead, who suggested that this statue be put at the, now former, entrance to Cherokee Park.

The statue was paid for by a collection from the citizens of Louisville and donated to the city. It was not paid for by the Daughters of the Confederacy. Castleman fought in the Civil War at age 22, was insignificant in that war and exiled by Lincoln.
We need to change the plaque and give out the real facts of this important Louisvillian. Remove any reference to the Cival War."
40204,Do not remove our history 
40219,"I hate the Mayor who sold our 3rd street monument.   

You can hate a statue if you want, but when I see John Castleman, I think of the 300,000 white Union soldiers who had to die in the prime of life, to end slavery.  Although the men on the statues like John Castleman and Jefferson Davis survived, these men participated in killing over 300,000 white union soldiers to keep slavery.  John Castleman was a Morgan's Raider and delegate to the Democratic party.  Davis was the Democrat Senator from Mississippi.  Maybe the protestors don't want to be reminded that these men voting and fighting for slavery were democrats.  Maybe they don't know the men fighting for slavery were democrats.  Maybe they don't care. John Castleman was to be executed as a confederate spy  (wickipedia).    After experiencing the loss of 750,000 lives, President Johnson pardoned him.  If a president who witnessed  this bloodbath can live with John Castleman, perhaps we can too.          

KEEP THE STATUES.  LOSE THE MAYOR"
40272,I feel better tuno the truth 
40204,"The equestrian statue that marks the entrance to Cherokee Park in the Cherokee Triangle neighborhood was never intended to be a Confederate monument. During the construction of Louisville’s Olmsted parks, a committee of Louisville citizens set about to create an “equestrian statue” in honor of General John B. Castleman for his many civic contributions to Louisville and the state of Kentucky. Indeed, the statue depicts him in equestrian garb astride his favorite horse, Carolina.

He was the tireless chairman of the parks committee that brought Frederick Law Olmsted to design a series of beautiful, now cherished parks in Louisville. For 20 years he commanded the Louisville Legion, charged with keeping the peace in Louisville and was recognized as one of the finest organizations of its kind in the nation. His leadership skills were sought by KY governors. On his death bed, Gov. Goebel asked Castleman to the quell the civil unrest in Frankfort that surrounded the assassination of Gov. Goebel. He received the rank of Adjutant General from two other governors, Gov. Knott and Gov. Beckham. He was awarded the rank of Brigadier General for his service in the U.S. Army during the Spanish-American War. He founded the American Saddlebred Horse Association.

Surely POCA is aware of Gen. Castleman’s civic contributions post-Civil War.

I believe that the question of whether or not the statue is a Confederate memorial relates to the Kentucky Historical Marker which is not original to the installation of the statue. The marker seems to highlight his role in the Civil War (which lasted a few years in his youth) over the original intent of the statue – honoring many years of service as an exemplary citizen of the United States. I believe that the ill-conceived text of the marker led to the statue being placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997 as a Civil War monument and subsequently being listed on various lists, such as the Southern Poverty Law Center’s list of Civil War monuments.

The Courier-Journal has suggested that Gen. Castleman was a segregationist. History must be our teacher here. In 1896 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that “separate but equal” would be the law of the land. Gen. Castleman’s remarks on the segregation of the parks indicate that his intention was that parks would be created for all citizens, even if segregated.

This beautiful statue of a man in equestrian garb is not honoring a Civil War hero. Rather, it honors a man whose accomplishments have benefited us all. He deserves an honored place in Louisville and Kentucky history. Even though the city of Louisville was gifted the statue at its dedication, the Cherokee Triangle has cared for this statue for 104 years knowing that it represents his contribution to the development of our Cherokee Park. Our oldest homes proudly display a centennial plaque with the statue’s image. It is part of the fabric of our neighborhood.

Will you look inside yourselves and determine if your actions at age 19 or 20 are the sum total of who you are now?

Will you remove a memorial to a citizen who exemplified the best of civic involvement, especially at a time in history when re-building a unified nation was so important?

Will you give in to loud voices demanding the removal of this statue, while they either don’t know its history or choose to ignore the truth? 

Retain the statue.
Remove the KY historical marker.

40299,"You can't change history so why are we trying!  Taking down statues and hiding them ,will not change the fact that slavery happened nor will fighting with ignorant people.people are coming from other states to start trouble in the name of diversity. Not in the name of History which can't be changed. Leave the statues were they are and work to change the future,not the past"
40204,"On August 22, 2017 the Cherokee Triangle Board of Trustees held their monthly board meeting.  There were 15+ visitors that came to express their feelings on the removing the Casselman statue.  100% of the neighbors that were present did NOT want the statue removed.

One person stated that if Castleman is removed, then so should Iroquois, Shawnee, Cherokee, Willow, and Tyler parks.  They are one in the same basically due to the contributions Castleman has made to Olmstead (his partner basically.)"
40241,"Watched Mayor Fischer's podcast on subject.  Glad for effort to discuss in civil, reasoned, nonviolent, nondestructive way.  Thank you.
Good to consider intention, art & history along with what the statue represents in today's thinking.
Not good to define people by one aspect of their lives.  No one is all good or all bad.  No one is without fault.  The fault should be condemned--in context, and corrected.  No improvement happens overnight.  People who want to tar and feather public figures of an earlier age are not necessarily fault-free themselves.
Proceeding slowly, in a reasoned way seems a good idea.
Erecting memorials to people who have suffered from public policy is a possibility. Setting up statues and memorials which present an historical story of development in society's thinking seems a possibility.
But, let's go further--research and discuss the history of slavery and suppression of many groups of people--ethnic, national origin, racial, religious, and many other categories, right here in this city.  
Human group activity is developmental, just as individuals are.  Not all of a person's behavior is good and not all is bad.  There's much more to be said on this subject.  
Let's do something positive and constructive.  How about a city-wide effort to fight modern forms of slavery--sex slave trade, various forms of abuse in families, one group acting out like children in order to deny another group's right to a different opinion, politically-motivated vandalism which costs a community money which could be spent in more beneficial ways, 
school bullying, elitism, various other forms of behavior...  Let's move forward while learning from the past.  
I would hate to see memorials to people like Washington and Jefferson removed--much less destroyed--because, as part of the popular attitude of their historical times, they owned slaves, even against their own consciences.  At least they struggled with that.  What they did for posterity was arguably much greater in the long run, and more beneficial to future generations than their participation in slavery, which is definitely evil.  And, certainly, their questions about slavery contributed to the eventual abolition of the use of slaves for labor which economically benefitted a relative few people in the society of that time.
Whatever age we live in, we're influenced by the general attitude around us, for better or worse. One or two hundred years from now, the people living in our time mightl be severely criticized for things we don't pay much attention to now."
40214,"ALL ART that is tied to racism, bigotry, slavery should be removed and replaced in an area that is appropriate where its history can be studied in context, especially since MY tax money is used for upkeep. I applaud the city and Mayor Fischer for removing the statue on the UofL campus that I pass by daily. "
40204,"The Castleman Statue 
Unfortunately, most of the statues in question are equestrian statues. It is sad to see the horses included in the blame and their elegant frames being dragged off on flatbed trucks. I can do without the General, but I would sorely miss Carolina. Why not remove the man and keep the horse? if that's not possible, then skip the search for the perfect human to honor and replace him with another beautiful steed poised at the head of Cherokee Parkway. A work of art by a living artist. Nature would triumph as well as the equine tradition of our city."
40272,"We should always remember our history, good and bad in order not to repeat it.  Our children need to be taught about our history so they can learn from it and understand how and why our Country and our citizens and our laws have gotten from Point A to Point B.   History is REAL.  We can not erase what was bad.  We need to be reminded of the good and the bad daily so we DO NOT forget.  I think SEEING the monuments MAKES IT REAL and not just something we read about a long time ago in a book.  When I was a child, like most children, I did not understand the importance of history.  Being an adult now, I see it was one of the most important things one needs to know."
40217,"We should not use public spaces to honor those who dedicated their lives to defend racist systems like slavery and segregation. It's true that the statues are historically significant, but those types of works are more appropriate in museums. "
40217,"Louisvillians, and Mayor Fischer, believe this city to be a so-called ""compassionate"" one, and while I truly think that we are working toward that vision, I firmly believe that it is impossible for us to realize that goal while ignoring or discounting the views and lived-experiences of our city's most marginalized residents. The hate, bigotry, and prejudice that have been on-display in recent weeks are something we should not simply condemn but something must work to positively counter-act. I understand that many white Louisvillians will say that these statues, monuments, and names are a part of *our* ""history"" and ""heritage"" and that removing or changing any of them amounts to a sanitization of that history; however, I would just like to say in response that these items are in and of themselves a sanitization of history. They were installed at a time of Civil War revisionism by those espousing the ideology of the Confederacy's ""Lost Cause,"" and never once were the thoughts, feelings, and lived experiences of our city's black population taken into account. Today we know better. We know that these items are important symbols to the newly reinvigorated and empowered KKK, to Neo-Nazis, and to the alt-right. Even if these symbols mean next to nothing to many of the people who see them daily, the fact that we tolerate them in our community is tantamount to tolerating and consenting to the violence and hatred of those who hold them in the highest regard. For me, that is unacceptable. To become a truly Compassionate City, we must recognize that the City that erected these monuments is not the city that exists today and is not the city that we want to be today. We can no longer ignore any marginalized part of our body politic, and in that spirit, we must remove these statues, change any offending street names, and truly show the State, Country, and World how compassionate Louisville really could be. "
40220,"I do not feel any statues should be removed. Each generation lives in their own time. Everything in life is a lesson. Each generation learns from the past and we try and move forward on the correct path. We could erect additional statues that show a more positive outlook on life.

On a different topic... I am very offended by the graffiti everywhere. I cringe every time I see it. The only way to curb this is to paint over it within 24 to 48 hours. When they realize it is going to be eliminated as soon as they spray paint it will be less and less. I head this is what Chicago did. Also, I thought the city could erect 4 or 5 walls around the city (walls like the ones along the interstate), they could spray paint on those and every 4 months paint over them for a new canvess. While were at it the skate park... the city spent a lot of money on this for the kids. I feel it should be closed until it can be cleaned up. Next time it happens, close it down longer. These kids should respect this place. Show them that there are consequences for their actions. Maybe they will deter graffiti in the future if they realize the park will close a period of time. This is life.

The graffiti makes our city look horrible."
40204,"I support for taking down the Castleman statue. I have lived in my house on Baringer for ten years, just a couple blocks away. Although it's been lovely having it in the neighborhood, now that I know more about John Castleman and his values he is not someone I want to honor. I haven't figured out a brilliant idea for who we could honor instead, yet. But but if the Muhammad Ali Center would be willing I think that having JC's statue there--with vandalism intact--might be just right. 

Although I'm an art history major and not a fan of even touching art, much less sloshing it with paint, I'm actually somewhat glad that this particular vandalism occurred. It has started and kept this conversation, however painful and awkward, going in our neighborhood. Moving the statue to the MAC could allow the conversation to continue. We should absolutely have a historical plaque in the old plaque location explaining the statue's removal. 

I truly feel like we are beginning to ride a slow wave toward some actual racial equality in Louisville and the U.S. It's been a long time coming and we can help make it happen a little faster by starting right here. 

Thank you, Jenny Morse 2007 Baringer Ave 40204 "
40205,"Leave the Castleman statue alone.  Do however remove the historical marker which references his CSA involvement.

As a young man Castleman was on the side of the Confederacy.  After the war he spent his life in service to his Country and to Louisville.  Are we all to be judged by our darkest moments?  I hope not.

If you do take down Castleman then you need to evaluate all statues harshly.  Daniel Boone.  Indian killer and owner of 200 slaves.  How will you reconcile that?

Good luck in your task.  

Regards, Bill.

"
40214,"Why the City maintains the statue of George Prentice is beyond me. This man through his position of a news paper editor instigated the worse anti-immigrant massacre in US History.  The German and Irish Catholics were his targets. For days.  His rantings against foreign swarms loyal to the Pope cumulated into the killing of from dozens to 2000 Catholic  of Irish and German  immigrants. Catholic churches were targeted.  Hundreds of homes were set on fire. This denigration came to be known as Bloody Monday   The rioters carried the American Flag  not the Confederate flag. but I pray this abomination will not be put aside because of this fact.  Hundreds of Catholic left the City and settle in Cincinnati. southern Indiana and other cities.  Yes there is historic monument on  West Main Street recognizing this outrage and Prentice later apologized.  I first learned of Bloody Monday in Catholic Grade School. and this incident has always haunted me since then,  I am now 80. please at least move this statue so I and other Irish and German descendants do not have to engage this statue when approaching the library. I have avoided the library when possible.
Another thought If anyone deserves a statue it is the Mayor of the time a no nothing party member JOHN BARBEE. whose intervention likely save the Cathedral.  We should also look at how the Protestant leaders and Catholic Bishop called for calm without revenge                    "
40228,"Please do not remove our precious art / statues/ etc.  What is next, Locust Grove, rename streets, it's our history which we have successfully worked  ? I do not feel any art which has been in the public eye for any period of time should be removed

 "
40203,"The current national debate is primarily centered around statues erected to celebrate and honor confederate ""heroes"" of the civil war.

I really love the aesthetics of the statue and the landmark it represents to the Highlands community and am reluctant to see it taken down unless there is a clear association of Castleman with the Cvil War and racism. For me the case for taking down the Castleman statue is not as clear cut as it was for the confederate memorial at U of L or the Morgan and Breckenridge statues in Lexington (all of which I support(ed) being moved).  These moments are exclusively about celebrating the Civil War and by association slavery and racism.  Was the Castleman statue erected for the same purpose, to honor his participation in the Civil War, or was it celebrating his life more holistically i.e. his civic and community service as well as his participation in the Spanish American War?    I think a good place to start would be to go back to documents commissioning the statue and its official dedication to clarify the motivation for erecting the statue. If its primary purpose was to honor and commemorate his Civil War service than maybe the statue should be taken down (even though i would really miss it as would many in the neighborhood), however if the original intent of the statue was to honor Castleman for his broader contribution to the country and community, I would be against the statue being taken down/moved.  If the statue is to stay however, I would remove, de-emphasize, or place in context his participation in the Civl War. 
"
40220,"General Castleman's statue never had anything to do with bigotry, racism, or slavery. Instead, it honors him as the father of Louisville's magnificent parks. It credits his service to his country as general in the United States army. It reflects his founding of the United States Saddlehorse Association.
The statue is a beautiful work of art that graces an entrance to our city's parks. Castleman sits serenely and in control of his multi-gated horse who is balanced on two legs--just as he used to ride to work supervising the parks. (I used to teach the statue in my Art History class.)
Destroying the statue or even removing it from its meaningful site betrays ignorance about the statue and a dangerous narrow-mindedness "
40223,"I think ALL Confederate statues should be left alone.  Where will it end?  The Jefferson Memorial, Mount Rushmore, the Washington Monument?  These statues and monuments have been in place for many years.  Why do we have to remove them just because the leftys have a hissie fit.  They are always having hissie fits.  This is our history and we don't agree with all of it now but we can learn from all of it.  This should be put to a vote.  "
40215,"  Allow Individuals or Groups to submit comments and narratives to the Commission, about public statues & art works.  These statements could be synthesized by the Commission into the potential placement of an "" Alternative Viewpoint"" Plaque, by the pertinent statues or art works.   This is in addition to Other Options as decided by the Commission. "
40216,Andrew Cowan is the person we should be praising in front of Cherokee Park. Castleman represents repugnant aristocracy and praise for the Confederacy. Future generations will see this as well. 
40218,Wasn't the civil war about northern oppression.  The north was dying economically and the south was booming..  Slavery entered into it as an aside.  Historic statues as art or whatever should be a sense of pride for all.  They are works of art.  My forefather was likely an indentured servant from England in 1648.  Look how fortunate I am to live in this great Country because of him.
40291,"  Dear Mayor:  I love the way you have phrased the guidelines your using to determine if a piece of art stays or goes.  No mention of the time in our history these pieces represents.  The mastery involved in the creation of these statues.  The artist's interpretation of the moment in time they represented, etc.  It doesn't take much imagination as to where this is going or should we say not going.  I say it is a matter of interpretation as to each individual and how they chose to interpret it.  If people chose to see racism, bigotry, etc. they will.  If people chose to honor a time in history when their ancestors persevered, overcame ever adversity in their lives and put their lives on the line for those generations to come, they will.  After all these slaves suffered, to say that now this generation of people are totally upset by a statue is a sad state of affairs.  

What a sad state of affairs, that people today have decided once again to divide our country over such minor affairs as statues  I fear so many are not able to see the big picture and are falling for an old scam that has been going on for years.  how very childish to say that just because we want to preserve our history that we are bigots or racist.  I fear MAYOR, THAT YOU TO ARE A PART OF THE GROUP THAT IS TRYING TO DIVIDE RATHER THAN UNITE OUR COUNTRY.   SHAME, SHAME, SHAME!!! "
40245,"Slavery is, unfortunately, a part of our past which I'm sure we would like to forget.  However, when I drive by a monument to a former Confederate soldier, I am reminded of the futility of that war, and the horrendous loss of life during the Civil war.  Many civil war veterans went on to perform great service to our country after the war.  Our congress welcomed them back into the nation.   Robert E. Lee was instrumental in creating learning institutions for both white and black.  If the views on slavery are to be a litmus test for who we honor as contributing to our great country, we must tear down monuments to Washington, Jefferson, Madison, and even Lincoln who felt blacks were inferiour and exempted Ky from his Emancipation Proclamation, and favored repatriation to Africa for the slaves.  They were flawed, just as we are flawed today.  Tearing down monuments is akin to the actions taken in Afghanistan, when thousand year old monuments were destroyed because they represented a different culture and belief system.  We should educate, not deny our past."
40208,"The Castleman statue in the Cherokee Triangle should be removed. The two reasons to support the monument are 1) that he served the Union post-Civil War after serving the Confederacy, which points to a change of heart, and 2) that he is largely responsible for the establishment of the Olmsted parks system. Concerning the first, a man who supported the Confederacy against the Union did not merit a monument. While his motivation remains a matter of conjecture, it seems that his ""conversion"" was very much to his own benefit once the contest was decided in favor of the Union.  As for the second reason, the appropriateness of the monument's proximity to Cherokee Park, Eric Burnette points out that he was more entrepreneur than benefactor with regard to the Louisville park system (""Thank Andrew Cowan for Louisville Parks, not Castleman,"" Courier-Journal: May 26, 2017 online): ""If Castleman had his way, Olmsted never would have been hired and Cherokee Park would be about the same size and location as Tyler Park... In fact, Tyler Park – designed largely by John C. Olmsted – is one of Castleman’s only significant park legacies. Half of it was built on land he sold to his own Park Commission at a markup."" Burnette also points out that Castleman was responsible first for the segregation of Louisville's public park tennis courts and ultimately of its parks. Castleman wrote, ""The same right that induces our liberal provision for their [""our negro fellow citizens""] separate education should impel us to provide for them separate recreation grounds."" 

The monument to George D. Prentice that stands before the York St. entrance to the Louisville Free Public Library also should be removed. Prentice, editor of the Louisville Journal and supporter of the Know-Nothing Party, wrote pro-slavery, anti-Catholic and anti-immigrant editorials that inflamed public sentiment to the point that he can be considered a contributor to the riots on the day known as ""Bloody Monday,"" August 6, 1855, in which Irish and German immigrants were attacked, wounded and killed and their property destroyed. It is ironic that only a handful of yards away on S. 4th St. stands the statue of Abraham Lincoln. Fittingly, Lincoln's back is to Prentice.
"
44138,"First let me say I am a (white) Black Lives Matter supporter. I am also a horsewoman and a devotee of the American Saddlebred. So, I have very conflicted feelings about the mounted statues, especially when the horse is known. They are so, so close to the Kentucky Horse Park. Can't they be donated where it will be the horse that is the focal point and not the rider? I have suggested to the Horse Park they do an exhibit on horses in war throughout history, haven't heard from them. I have heard from the Saddlebred museum (not the board who has the authority to decide) and they feel the same way I do. The horse art is beautiful and historic, and breed specific. 
My idea comes largely from the Animals in War monument in London. ""They had no choice."""

General Castleman was related to many other famous cousins of his and mine that are household names that were on both sides of the war.  That said, Castleman invested his life before, during, and after the Civil War to KENTUCKY and he is the ""FATHER OF THE LOUISVILLE PARKS SYSTEM,"" and his life was much more than what happened during those five years of the war.

His first and middle name comes from another shared cousin, U.S. Vice President John Cabell Breckinridge.  Many of our other cousins are listed on: www.brennancallan.com/fam1.html

Best wishes CTA Members.  I am glad the organization exists and I hope you have the fortitude to fight the corruption in City Hall!

40204,"This rediculous event will be looked back upon with wonder. How a Louisville mayor, let a tiny portion  of young, rebellious, kids, dictate what goes on with local valuable art and history, will be looked upon with wonder.
Our Mayer is so afraid of a tiny portion of kids, that he would even consider removing valuable, and lovely works of art. This looks so bad for our city, and country. When this foolishness is over, wheather statues are removed or not, the future will wonder who in the world were these fearful politicians? 
It would be rediculous to remove the Cstleman Monument, we apparently have a gut-less Mayor, whose fear of rebellious children is strong enough to harm

This event has made me feel so much less for our city, I literally have lost respect for this area in a way I never thought possible.
My support for this city, financially and emotionally will be changed forever if the Castleman Monument is removed. The mayor will be thought of as an idiot in the future years, I garentee it . CLewman"
40272,"I never would have thought the below quote would be relevant in the 21st century.

After the surrender at appomattox Grant ordered his troops to stop all celebration, saying the ""war is over; the rebels are our countrymen again.""

All confederate troops are US military veterans by the US government. Vandalizing monuments to confederate troops is equivalent to vandalizing the WW2, Vietnam, or Korean memorials. In addition Robert E Lee was personally opposed to slavery and his wife even broke the law and taught slaves to read and write. To say that his statue promotes racism and bigotry is to show complete ignorance of history."
85283,"I am a Louisville native and and U of L alum. I still visit the city and follow events, especially via the C-J and various sports media outlets

I have very strong feelings that all Civil War monuments should be removed. I am Anglo but can imagine the pain this causes our African American citizens. 

If there are appropriate private museums whose members do not object, the monuments could be placed there. If not, in my opinion the statutes could be destroyed 

I know many will disagree. But I believe these monuments serve no useful purpose and have no place in a society striving for freedom and equality for all

40213,"This issue should not require debate. Louisville must remove public statues that are vile symbols of racism, white supremacy, and white privilege. If Louisville public officials do not act and remove these appalling statues our collective inaction will serve to reinforce and further entrench systemic and institutional racism. If we do not act immediately we risk empowering Nazis and neo-facists who have no place in our neighborhoods or the Commonwealth of Kentucky.

Let's begin, as a city, to show real leadership and stand up for people of color in our communities. White people in public office have an extraordinary opportunity to disrupt white privilege. We can choose to stop dismissing and minimizing concerns coming from people of color. We don't have to limit  public discussion to statues. Together we can stop working to maintain white dominance as the status quo, recognize these issues as a lived-reality in which white people are complicit, and be willing to acknowledge that white people in Louisville enjoy tremendous unearned privileges.  

This is not an issue of something that ""can be interpreted to be honoring bigotry, racism and/or slavery."" There is no ""can"" about this issue: white people and white elected officials must choose to help dismantle racism. "
40241,"With regard to the statue of George D. Prentice, which stands next to the Main Library on 4th Street, I believe there may be no statue which represents a more active bigot, given his activities during his adult life.

n the 1850s, Prentice editorialized in support of the Know-Nothing party and the pro-slavery, anti-Catholic and anti-foreigner movement that reached a hysterical level in the 1850s in many parts of the nation.

In Louisville this culminated in the Bloody Monday riot of 1855, in which 22 people were killed. Just days before the riots, which occurred as mobs tried to prevent Irish and German citizens from voting on election day, Prentice had editorialized against the ""most pestilent influence of the foreign swarms"" loyal to a pope he called ""an inflated Italian despot who keeps people kissing his toes all day.""

I don't believe that any statue should necessarily be destroyed. I also believe that some statues represent people whose deeds were acceptable within the context of the times they lived, but are viewed as reprehensible today. There are also those, like Mr. Prentice, whose personal actions were way beyond the pale then and deserve to be remembered as such now.

Mr. Prentice participated himself in firing up some of the most disgusting forms of bigotry, resulting in fomenting riots and the deaths of innocent Irish and German citizens on Bloody Monday in Louisville.

If it happened today, he would be tried for interfering with citizens' constitutional voting rights, and for being an accomplice to murder.

Please remove this statue."

40204,"CASTLEMAN STATUE – KEEP ON CHEROKEE PARKWAY
The John B. Castleman Statue is one of the most beautiful works of public art in the city of Louisville.  This statue does not honor bigotry, racism or slavery.  It honors a man who dedicated much of his life to public service to Louisville and the state of Kentucky.  Yes, he was a member of the Confederate Army for 4 years, beginning when he was age 22, until he was captured and imprisoned at age 26.  He was a young officer, but never a great Confederate leader and certainly not a General in the Confederate army. He should not suddenly be considered in the same category as Robert E. Lee or Jefferson Davis, who were leaders in the Confederacy.  After imprisonment and exile to France, Castleman was pardoned by President Andrew Johnson.  He later became a U.S. patriot and served in the United States Military where he attained the rank of General.  Castleman moved to Louisville in 1866, graduated from the UofL Law School in 1868 and became a successful businessman.  During his life in Louisville from 1866 until his death in 1918, he was a civic leader, most notably serving as President of the Louisville Parks Commission, which initiated the Olmsted Parks System.  He also was the founder and longtime president of the American Saddlebred Horse Association.  
This statue honors his public service with respect to the Olmsted Park system and the American Saddlebred Horse Association.  The statue does not honor any of his military service.  He is wearing civilian clothes.  There is an unfortunate historic marker, which was added in 1997, and this marker does allude to his time in the Confederate army.  This historic marker was placed in 1997 at the time that the statue was added to the National Register of Historic Places.   I do not know who is responsible for that designation and marker, but I am quite confident that at that late date there was never any intention of glorifying his Confederate service.  My guess is that that the historic designation was done in hopes that the statue might qualify for federal grants for restoration.  That historic marker now needs to be removed and replaced by one that more accurately portrays the important contributions that Castleton made to the City of Louisville.  The statue itself does not need to be removed.  This man spent only 4 years in his early 20s as a Confederate soldier.  He spent the rest of his life after the Civil War, for over 50 years, in service to the city of Louisville and the Commonwealth of Kentucky.  We all believe in redemption.  We should not let those few years of Confederate service define him.  He had no major role in war.  His contributions to Louisville far outweigh his 4 years as a Confederate soldier.  The City should be able to find a way to take away the designation of the statue as a Civil War monument and all reference to his Civil War service.     
It must be a daunting task for individuals asked to serve on a Commission on Public Art to suddenly be thrust into an explosive political controversy and asked to render judgments not about the quality of a work of art, but about its historic context.  It seems to me that a trained historian has unique qualifications when it comes to such an evaluation and I certainly hope that the Public Art Commissioners will avail yourselves of the expertise of trained historians. The only one who comes readily to mind is Tom Owen, who happens to be a former City Councilman who represented the Cherokee Triangle for many terms.  He is often called upon throughout the city for his expertise as a historian.  In fact, the University of Louisville website for Tom Owen identifies him as an expert on the politics of the Civil War and the history of Louisville. See: https://php.louisville.edu/advancement/ocm/expertsource/expertdetails.php?fname=Thomas&lname=Owen (Note: The email address in this site is not correct, but the phone number is.)
I do implore the Commission on Public Art to not allow this decision to become a popularity contest, based on social media posts.  I am a member of the Next Door network for the Cherokee Triangle and adjoining neighborhoods.  The Castleman statue has become the main topic of posts in the last few weeks.  Much of what I am reading in these posts is appalling.  Like much of the social media world today, many people believe that they can say anything and that their opinions should control, regardless of the merits or factual basis of what they say.  Many of the posts exhibit an absence of any legitimate research or any real knowledge of history and often rely on false information gleaned from some other person, who also has not done the research.  It is the typical “if you saw it on the Internet, it must be true.”  Many of the posts have begun to deviate from the purpose for which the statue is being evaluated.  Some are calling for the statue to be removed because Castleman was a rich, old white man, who didn’t really deserve a statue.  Regardless of whether rich, old white males are over-represented in public statues, that is not really the point.  The issue should be much more narrow:  Was this statue erected to glorify racism, bigotry or slavery? There is no evidence that that was the motivating purpose when this statue was commissioned.  And there is no evidence that the people who are asking for the statue to remain are doing so for those impermissible purposes.     
I acknowledge that I am not an historian.  However, I majored in government and history at the College of William and Mary and I am very familiar with the history of the civil rights struggles, as I did civil rights work for over 10 years before I went to law school at the University of Louisville.  As a lawyer in a large civil litigation firm, I spent the majority of my time doing legal research in order to write legal briefs.  So, I do know something about research and how to discount statements or arguments that are not based on the facts.    
As for me.  Even though I am a white female, I do believe that Black Lives Matter.  For over 10 years I was employed in positions first with the state of Kentucky, then with the federal government, working to promote equal opportunity for African Americans in housing, public accommodations and employment.  I have also served on boards promoting those purposes.  Equal opportunity is a cause that I truly believe in.  I very proudly voted for President Obama.  I abhor all that the neo-Nazis and white nationalists stand for.  
Nevertheless, as a 40 year resident of the Cherokee Triangle, I love the Castleman statue as a wonderful work of public art.  I am not an artist.  However, I am an art collector and I do love art.  The Castleman statue is a thing of beauty that brings great joy to me every time I see it, which is almost every day.   I have always been aware that Castleman served in the Confederate Army, but I never, ever thought that this statue was meant to honor that service.  Over the years I have been very active with the Cherokee Triangle Association serving as a Trustee and on many committees.  I have never once heard one Cherokee Triangle resident praise or glorify Castleman’s service in the Confederate Army.  
I have always thought of the statue as a tribute to a man who was instrumental in establishing the Olmsted Parks and the American Saddlebred Horse Association, and I believe that is how the majority of Cherokee Triangle residents view it.  Although there is a current book out that attempts to debunk the importance of Castleman’s role in bringing Olmsted to Louisville to design the city park system, that is not really the point.  That author also recently wrote an opinion piece for the Courier Journal, but it was clearly only opinion.  He made broad generalizations in that piece that were not supported by footnotes or references to primary sources.  Even if that author is correct, and I acknowledge I have not read the book, it makes no sense for a public statue to come down whenever later generations determine that the person was not important enough or did not really do enough to warrant a statue.  
I have been doing research on Castleman and the Castleman statue and the results confirm many of my beliefs.  One of the most edifying documents of all is the autobiography of General Castleman, published by the Courier Journal in 1917.  I strongly urge any person who is involved in decision making on this statue to read this book, which is available online.  In fact, I feel that it would be irresponsible not to read it.  There is an entire chapter which addresses how this statue came about.  There are many testimonials from leading citizens of the day, praising the public service of General Castleman.  None of these testimonials rely on his service in the Confederate army.  All praise his civic service, primarily as it relates to the Parks and the American Saddlebred Horse Association.  One website where the book can be found is: https://ia600207.us.archive.org/33/items/cu31924032780649/cu31924032780649.pdf  Lots of scrolling down is often necessary to get through some blank pages.  The Chapter entitled “An Equestrian Statue” begins on page 255.  I think it is important that Castleman himself described the statue as “an equestrian statue”.  He did not call it a Confederate statue.  
Some of the opponents of keeping the statue claim that Castleman paid for the statue of himself and they use that as an argument for why it should be removed.  That argument is irrelevant to whether this statue was erected to honor bigotry, racism or slavery.  Moreover, that argument appears to be inaccurate.  Castleman’s autobiography quotes many people, who donated money for the statue.  
Castleman’s book reports that the original cost of the statue was $15,000.  It is very important to recognize that twice in my 40 years in the neighborhood, the Cherokee Triangle Association has paid significant sums to have the statue restored.  I have not been a Trustee in recent years.  However, I attended the August 2017 meeting of the Trustees of the Cherokee Triangle.  Although the exact figures were not in front of him, in answer to my question, a current Trustee stated that those restorations cost the Cherokee Triangle over $60,000.  Other trustees confirmed that the Triangle currently maintains the lighting and landscaping of the statue.  Consequently, it seems that great weight should be given to the opinions of the residents of the Triangle and the Trustees.  (As an aside, it seems to me that if one were considering what has been spent on the statue, the Cherokee Triangle Association has a greater claim to ownership of the statue than the City of Louisville.  As best I can tell, that original $15,000 was  money donated by citizens, not money spent by the City.)
The author of the book seeking to minimize Castleman’s role in bringing about Olmsted Parks, also is now claiming that once the parks were built, Castleman sought to keep the tennis courts in the parks segregated.  However, the author failed to put that claim in historical context.  Segregation was the law of the land.  The U.S. Supreme Court decision in Plessy v. Ferguson dictated separate but equal for the races as the law of the land.  Even though Castleman did not challenge the law, the public record shows that Castleman advocated for assuring that there were tennis courts for Blacks in the city parks.  
It can not be denied that John Castleman fought on the Confederate side in the Civil War.  However, his autobiography shows that long after the war, he maintained a warm relationship with the African Americans who had been owned as slaves by his parents in Lexington, Kentucky where Castleman was born. He writes in the book of the time he traveled from his home in Louisville to Lexington for the funeral of a former slave owned by his family. (Note: Castleman himself was too young to ever own a plantation or slaves before the Civil War.)  
Wikipedia states that when Castleman joined the Confederate Army, he was opposed to the institution of slavery, but an advocate of state's rights.  The footnote to this statement cites a Wisconsin State Journal article from 1918, but I am unable to pull this up.  Since anyone can write on Wikipedia, I am not making any pronouncement on the accuracy of this.  Castleman’s autobiography does not really explain his political views or what motivated him to join the Confederate army.      
However there is a primary source which demonstrates that Castleman did not try to perpetuate slavery or hatred of blacks after the war.  An October 25, 1917 Courier Journal article reported on a controversy that arose when a white soldier in the U.S. Army refused to salute an African American officer.  The Courier Journal reported this response by General Castleman:  ""I have held several commissions in the military service and I unhesitatingly say that I would or will, at any time, salute an officer, superior or inferior, who salutes me, without regard to the color of his skin.""   
For all of the above reasons, I believe that the Castleman statue should remain on Cherokee Parkway.  It was placed at this location for a reason.  The statue was purposely located at the entrance to Cherokee Park to honor Castleman’s service in developing Louisville’s Park System.

,"George D Prentice's statue at the Public Library should have been removed a long time ago; the current plaque is not enough (if it was, the 3rd st statue could have remained with an additional plaque). Maybe the Prentice statue should be returned to the CJ building.

Segment From Wikipedia:
George Dennison Prentice (December 18, 1802 – January 22, 1870) was the editor of the Louisville Journal, which he built into a major newspaper in Louisville. He attracted readers by satire as well as exaggerated reporting and support of the Know-B=Nothing Party in the 1850s. 
His writing was said to contribute to rabid anti-Catholic and anti-foreigner sentiment, and a riot in 1855.
In the 1850s, Prentice editorialized in support of the Know-Nothing party and the pro-slavery, anti-Catholic and anti-foreigner movement that reached a hysterical level in the 1850s in many parts of the nation.
In Louisville this culminated in the Bloody Monday riot of 1855, in which 22 people were killed. Just days before the riots, which occurred as mobs tried to prevent Irish and German citizens from voting on election day, Prentice had editorialized against the ""most pestilent influence of the foreign swarms"" loyal to a pope he called ""an inflated Italian despot who keeps people kissing his toes all day.""
His legacy is generally unfavorable, with an editor from his own paper calling Prentice's writings ""raw bigotry"" in a 1993 feature on the history of the newspaper. 
A statue of Prentice by Alex Bouly was completed in 1875. It was originally displayed at the Courier-Journal building in Louisville, Kentucky, but was moved in 1914 to its present location in front of the Louisville Free Public Library’s main branch. It has been a source of occasional controversy, due to Prentice's famous anti-Catholic and anti-immigrant rhetoric.

40245,"Only in America would a small group of people attempt to exert their will upon others. I tecently teturned from Europe where statues in all forms exist - most with religious and war themes. People are walking past them every day and dont seem to be offended or annoyed by them. I am part of the silent majority that you never hear from. My peers and I are very concerned about where this purge of history will ultimately lead. Perhaps book censorship and word censorship are next. Unstead of letting a handful of people decide what we can look at I would suggesr putting it to a city vote. If these folks are really concerned about what these statues are ""saying"" how about a plaque that would put the display in context. You will find that these voices are not interested in  compromise. "
40202,"The Castleman statue needs to be moved.  All eyes are on you, Louisville.  We need to do the right thing. Sadly, this is part of our history, be we do not have to celebrate it. We need to heal and this could be a step and gesture in the right direction. Please relocate this statue. Thank you."
40207,"Very concerned. Art and history can make us uncomfortable. History can make us uncomfortable and it important that it does.

I am uncomfortable, as a white male, with the portrayal of blacks in ""Gone With the Wind"" for example, and that discomfort is important for my understanding, empathy and tolerance....and for society as a whole. 

Statues are art and history, they are not political statements, nor are they animate. 

We don't celebrate Castleman, but our ancestors did. It is impossible to put a modern lens on these people in any reasonable or informed way.

Finally, a very small minority are vocal on this and thier logic is extremely flawed. They reconstruct history to suit their wishes. Slaveholders were a minority, half the people here today came from immigrants after1865 and slavery was not confined to just white owners. In fact, a lot of people died to abolish slavery. Yet their unspoken underlying assertion is that if I disagree - that I too am racist.

Removing art and history will cause more division. It is dangerous for the society and it won't end with statues. Appeasement never ends well when the appeasement is not the right solution.

There are a lot of things I'd like to change, yet I realize that to change them would diminish individual liberty.....so I accept it."
40204,"Re:	The Castleman statue
	Questions raised about the Castleman statue may be well intended but, unfortunately, are terribly misinformed.  The Castleman statue – unlike countless monuments to the fallen South and its Confederate military leaders – was never intended nor by implication meant to honor the Confederate cause.  It was intended to honor an exemplary citizen who played a major role in the establishment of the Olmsted park system, Tyler Park and Eastern Parkway.  He served as a brigadier general in the U.S. Army, formed the American Saddle Bred Horse Association and was called upon by several Kentucky governors to maintain peace and avoid civil strife during times of unrest.  
	He was also born in the South, and like hundreds of thousands of his fellow citizens, took up arms as a youth in the cause of the Confederacy.  This brief chapter in his life is inordinately underscored in the relatively recent plaque chosen to accompany the statue so as to justify its inclusion as a Civil War monument.  If  this period in Castleman’s  20s is ultimately wiped clean from the plaque, and more detail is added about the fifty and more years of his adult life spent as a model citizen and U.S. soldier, then compromise will be achieved and a “politic” solution obtained. 
	One should be careful, however, that the wiping clean of a life might set a precedent undesirable for the future.  First, let us take note of what historical leaders of the 19th century desired for the reconstruction South.  Lincoln, Grant, Sherman, Seward, and the more enlightened “victors” did NOT seek obscurity, or worse, calumny and persecution for any and all who had fought for the South.  Instead, they sought redemption and reconciliation. No one could epitomize that desire better than John B. Castleman.  
Second, let’s remember that a concept misused for a purpose – good or bad – at one point in history, may become the precedent for an undesirable purpose in the future.  Many youth today – of any color – may commit serious crimes for which they may one day be pardoned, then redeemed through their good works.  What a wonderful story, you may say?  But what if a powerful, populist movement arises, condemning any and all for their past crimes and indiscretions?  What if civil disobedience, is seen at some point in the future, as a form of treason and the great leaders of the Civil Rights movement come under attack?  Will their monuments and remembrance be stricken in the haste to meet the demands of  a vocal minorities’ sense of right and wrong?  Sound absurd? So would many of the pronouncements and Executive Orders of the Trump presidency – but they are real and their end is not in sight.  Louisvillians declare that we are a city dedicated to Restorative Justice, but to realize that goal, we must use reason, knowledge of history and principles common to all in our decision making.  When humanity is painted with a broad brush, unforgiving and unrelentant, we lie ensnared in the same emotional quagmire as our brothers and sisters embroiled in positions contrary to our own.  It is a very slippery slope.  
Finally, any movement with an expectation of success needs to choose its battles as to avoid the besmirching and obscuring of its greater cause and future effectiveness.  The controversy over U.S. General Castleman only trivializes, distracts and diminishes the greater cause sought by those opposed to eulogizing the Confederacy. 
The current furor over General Castleman’s statue is most definitely not in the same category as monuments to fallen heroes of the South.  My good friend, the late Charles Bracelen Flood, born and raised in New York City and a lifelong Lincoln Republican, authored a critically well-received biography of the last years of Robert E. Lee.  Lee survived only five years after the Civil War.  But as Mr. Flood set forth in his biography of Lee’s last years, Lee used those years to revive a failing university, now known as Washington & Lee.  It would appear that in the emotions of the present, Lee’s memory – whether it be his service for the United States in the Mexican War and the years thereafter, or the civilian years after the Civil War – will be lost because of his role as a Confederate general.  Fortunately, that is not the controversy at hand.  Castleman’s life extended far beyond the Civil War and his achievements in Louisville and Kentucky were so considerable that his monument should never have been lumped into a Civil War setting. 
Besides the occasional misleading characterization of the Castleman statue as “Confederate” by the media, the only negative, racially related context in which Castleman is mentioned is with regard to segregation.  A passage attributed to Castleman and appearing in the Louisville papers 100 years ago attribute segregation sentiments to Castleman – very possibly accurate.  To this extent, one should be reminded that in 1896, the U.S. Supreme Court made Plessy v. Ferguson and the “separate but equal doctrine” the law of the land.  It was this law and its context in which Castleman’s remarks were made.  
Desegregation, as we saw post-Brown v. Board of Education, some 38 years later, was simply not a reality at the time of Castleman’s life.  While we may laud the efforts of our recent ancestors in the Great Civil Rights Movement, we are shortsighted and foolish in condemning the entirety of those who in earlier times accepted the law of the land and urged equal – if separate – facilities to those in society who deserved those amenities – like parks – which were clearly enjoyed by others.  Historical context must never be ignored.  
Revisionist history evokes a smug and often satisfying feel – and it is certainly a useful microscope by which to view the past.  But carried to extremes it can blind us to what Lincoln called “our better angels.”  Focus on Lincoln’s words in the Douglas debates and you would call him a racist.  Our forefathers were often slave-holders.  American Natives were clearly the victims of genocide.  The Jewish community in Louisville suffered exclusion from various clubs and community groups until recent date.  My Irish ancestors arrived in Portland after a devastating famine only to have their lives considered expendable as day laborers.  President Theodore Roosevelt could be characterized as an Imperialist.  His distant cousin, President Franklin Roosevelt interred Japanese.  Presidents Kennedy and Johnson could be judged as slow to embrace Civil Rights.  Where does it stop?  Our nation did not start with our collective conscience nor will it end with it. 
All of these propositions are merely offered to make us stop and think – a process often lost in today’s sense of immediacy.  The Castleman statue is the issue at hand – and it is an issue simple and straightforward.  It sits at the entrance to a park system that might not have existed without his will and sense of purpose, and honors a man who gave much to our city, redeemed by his life from any prior indiscretions.

,Leave those statues alone.
42701,"It is a disgrace to remove any Confederate statues. There I a law that protects the statues. By removing the Confederate statues keep racism alive that is part of our Kentucky history and all the so called black activist is keeping racism alive. If the statues are removed then as a society we should remove all of the statues that have to do with black slave's and black activist, we should remain all of the streets that have to do with black activist. All this is ,is racism against white people. There are all black college's that's racist, we should do away with black history month because that is racist. It is not right to remove these statues. I see no American Indian statues or no statues for the Irish that where put into slavery fair is only fair. These statues should remain exactly where they are at for people to see what history is all about. Not to be hidden. These people that the statues are about are not alive anymore and slavery does not exist anymore. By removing the statues you are hiding our history and everyone should be able to view them to understand our history we need to stop supporting racism by the black activist and embrace our history.

40205,"Please remove monuments glorifying the Confederacy or the people who fought for it. These monuments and statues glorify the people who once tried to divide our country over their right to own people. These symbols mark a dark time in our lives that we are still recovering from today (with racism still being a daily part of our lives). It is important that we remember these times, not glorify them. "
40175,"  Its a shame that black people have to continue with the hatred towards our history. Its all about giving them more and more.  But if the confederate statues have to be moved because they are ""forms of art""  then this should include statues and monuments of black people.
I know many war vets who will tell you Ali (Clay) was a good boxer but he was a great draft dodger.  Move one then move them all.  The civil was is over.  And council woman Green knows if Dan Johnson was black she would have laughed off his accidental touching of that big moon.  History books will not be rewritten just to make them happy. Let it go..!"
40160,"The whole idea that moving a statue from a public place to a museum or a cemetary (other public places) is redundant.  So if they are in a musuem or cemetary, the symbolism, means something different? So in the public view, these rock or metal images of long dead men glorify them but in musuems and cemetaries, its just history.  If we are going to remove art from a public place to stave off the symbolism, are you not catering to the thought process, that anything denoting confederacy can be challenged based on its symbolism? So what about, Thomas Jefferson, he owned slaves, in this stance, anything denoting him should be shoved from the public eye.  So lets blast him off Mount Rushmore, right?  No?  but the symbolism of him being a slave owner, glorifies the confederacy, makes me thinks racism and we want to get rid of art that reminds us of hate. Right Mr. Mayor."
40245,"I believe this is a dangerous road the City leaders are going down. If you take a look at all of the art works around town, I would like to make a few points. First, I am of Irish/English heritage. Any art form representing the Roman Empire would offend me based on my ansestors were, most likely, slaves under their occupation. Any Egyptian art needs to come down, since Eygptians were slave holders. Do you want me to go on with this progression?

I hope you see where I'm going with this. Slavery, bigotry, has been around since the dawn of man. No race or ethnicity has a claim that they never owned slaves in some way in their past. When you go back 160 years in our past and put today's morals and perspectives in place, then you need to go all the way back to man's beginnings. 

I doubt this will be read because this has become a political issue. But I wanted you all to understand that human history, which most of us are sadly ignorant of , shows that slavery was widespread throughout the world. If we don't learn from it, we are doomed to repeat it.

,"The monuments are an expression of free speech.  If the monuments are going to be moved because they are ""offensive"", then I expect any and all protests that involve burning of the flag to be outlawed or moved to some unknown area for being offensive to me and every other veteran.

37115,"I hate when people say that Lincoln freed the slaves. The emancipation proclamation wasn't a legal document in the south because the south was then called the Confederate States of America. That's like Canada making a law and having the nerve to say those laws also apply in the US.When the south split, all Confederates were considered traitors to the north. When the union defeated the south, the Confederate States of America ceased to exist. Based on that reasoning, I don't understand why the Confederate history should be revered. A country that lived and died within 5 years doesn't deserve immortality. The point of statues I believe is to leave a lasting legacy. History is written by the winners. The south lost. Period. When the winners of history decide to rid itself of images of traitors generally the losers complain about that.Who do you think was offended when the statues of Saddam came crashing down like the walls of Jericho?It certainly wasn't the US!"

Thank you for opening up this dialogue about our city monuments.  These statues perpetuate our system of racism and it is time we removed them to be a truly compassionate city.  These are not works of art- they are symbols, often designed by the perpetrators, as vain attempts to whitewash the violence of the past. They should be removed to make way for new artworks, experiences and references for future generations. Removal of the white male monuments is the beginning of a process that will help allow our deep wounds to heal.  Cherokee Park and our Public Art spaces will be activated in new positive ways honoring the best of our past. In these spaces we will encourage creatives and the public to share new ideas and use these opportunities to bring us together. With the important gesture of removal, we will bring new determination to our more important journey of combating race inequality, income disparity, and other ails that destroy the fabric of our country. The core of our future Democracy lives in positive references, education and unbiased opportunities for all human beings. 
Thank you...
Aldy Milliken"
40206,"Public art needs to honor love, compassion, & be sensitive to many cultural differences...art honoring bigotry, racism and/or slavery is divisive, hurtful, and cruel.We want to be an inclusive city with sensitivity towards many different cultures & religions & RESPECTFUL of the differences."
40207,"I strongly believe that all monuments that symbolizes confederacy should be placed in a museum. Those who claim it is their history can go to the museum to view them. Having such monuments in federal and other civic places gives the impression that the bigotry that was purported by confederate leaders was okay back then and it is okay today. I thank the state and especially our mayor and his council for planning to move these monuments where they won't remind us black folks of the pain they caused us. There is a lot of other medium avenues we can use to teach our kids about the history of our county without seeing these monuments.

40214,"My first thought is that this country is a democracy, and that the registered voters should be allowed to vote on the statue issue.  If the majority is offended, then by all means, move them to a museum, or cemetery.

If the government is making the decision, and decides the statues should be removed, then ALL art should be removed, including Freedom Park by U of L.  Let's just not honor anyone for anything that may offend anyone."
40212,"I am wondering when this will stop? First a flag. Which there was more years of slavery under our national flag than under the Confederate flag. Now we are removing statues that were Confederate war leaders. Some who also went on to become president of OUR United States of America. Then what? Are we going to tear down our historical homes due to the fact they were built by slaves? Are we going to stop transporting goods via our railway system due to the fact the slaves built the tracks and they should be removed? Yes, I agree our past history is ugly and I am glad I did not live in times when slavery was the norm. That being said I believe that removing flags and statues will not help to heal wounds of those who feel oppressed or feel they are still being victims of racism. Do I believe racism still exists? Yes. Unfortunately, I do. I wish I could say our nation has moved past this. I do have hope that we are getting there, not because we have removed flags or statues, but due to the fact we are learning to be more excepting of each other and our differences. Hurricane Harvey and the video coverage I saw on all different news channels is proof of that. No matter what a human needed help and another human was helping. Removing flags and statues didn't do that! Humans did!!"
40204,"Focusing on this statue is a lazy way to for us to look in the mirror and feel like we're solving a problem that goes so far beyond the statue. Even having the discussion about it does nothing but divide us further. 

The only way to solve the problem of racism is to spend all our energies focusing on raising awareness of and trying to solve the issue presented in figure 6 here: https://www.census.gov/prod/2013pubs/acsbr11-17.pdf"
40222,"If we are removing any art, monuments, or signs of one all need to go. Lincoln, Martin Luther King, civil rights leaders, Muhammad Ali, all the junk at u of l, all of it. I mean seriously there is no discussion about this. We can have a huge statue of a man showing his genital but not of something that happened 150 years ago. Really??? If white and Christian has to go then so does black and Muslim need to go with it. We also need to get rid of the bell of Louisville. These are all things that has separated us. We also need to ask kfc to close and and leave the stay as Colonel Sanders resembles a Confederate image. You have all be out to destroy our history and our city so let's do it right..... Oh and these all black schools need to close immediately as they are segregating our community."
40067,"Either place statues in question in a museum, or add statues in those areas to celebrate others from our history. For example, Cherokee Triangle would have a statue honoring the Cherokee, there would be a statue of the first jockey to win the Kentucky Derby in Louisville, several statues of our amazing female history-makers would be added, etc. This is not erasing history; it is telling more of it. Thank you."
40299-7011,I think we need to leave history alone and just that in the past. This is ridiculous.  If we pick to  move ot take down statues yhen I think we need to change street signs back to orginal names  not  after Ali ect. It offends me. I often find myself asking why now. Have these statues not offened anyone ovwr that last several centuries?  Where does this stop?
40245,"Let history remain history! Should Germany tear down Auschwitz? It too, is a ""reminder""of something much more horrific than slavery. There are no slaves today, nor will there ever be in America again. Thank God. In Louisville, as in other cities plagued with violent protest, there is always looting. How does that further a cause! Perhaps there is an underlying problem. Build one on one relationships, don't force a  change of history  ( the South lost and slavery was abolished---bottom line!!!) I'm just sayin'



"
40245,"Let's remove all statues and public art that minorities may find offensive. Start with the Castleman statue in Cherokee Triangle, but also remove Thomas Jefferson's statue since he was obviously a racist white slave owner, and while we are at it change the county name to something non-offensive. We need to also remove the statue of King Louis XVI, remember your history folks. In 1777 he signed a royal decree, Police de Noirs, that effectively removed all African people from France accept those that were legally owned slaves by the French aristocracy. King Louie obviously did not like people of color...he has got to go too since he is obviously a bigot. Probably need to change the name of the city since it honors the name of racist and bigot. Mayor Fischer stated in 2016 at the removal of the Confederate memorial that stood for 125 years at UofL...and I am paraphrasing, ""Louisville is a progressive city with no place for symbols of racism and bigotry."" So let"
40214,"I think if you remove the statues,  I think the names of the streets need to be taken down & renamed, money should be defaced (George Washington was a slave owner, inherited 10 slaves) what a disgrace to honor that man on the $1 bill. Do you see where this is heading? It will be statues today, then what will offend someone tomorrow.  History is what it is, just History. People making this a issue of racism if statues are not removed is ridiculous. If you remove every element that depicted slavery in history, it won't change racism today.  Racism is in the hearts & minds of people and has nothing to do with statues, flags, cars, etc...Parents need to be parents and teach their children to treat EVERYONE with respect regardless of race.  This issue should elected on by the people of the commonwealth, put it on the Ballot to be voted on.  Let the people decide. "
40205,"I think the actions to remove the statues are non-sense and nothing more than the Democrats pushing a political agenda.  It is non-sense to think a statue promotes racism.  How could that be.  They've been there for years and no on ever idolized them or promoted them for that purpose.  The statue of Jefferson and Henry Clay are there for what they did for KY and Jefferson County, not because they owned slaves.  Grow up Louisville!  

The other thing these news items and protest are doing is nothing more than trying to stir up racism just as the Democrats have done since the 2016 elections were going on.  Time to call for peace rather than rioting ridiculously over a statue.

However, if you decide to remove these, then I say remove all forms of public art and statue because one will offend someone someday.  For example, please remove the statue of David in front of 21c - it is offensive. "
40213,I believe that the plaques or stones depicting slaves and how horrible they were treated down by Abraham Lincoln statue is gruesome and disturbing. These depict slavery however have not been mentioned in the removal of such. They need to go. 
40299,"I think the best thing to do for this situation is put the statues in a museum. If the worry is about having heritage taken away, it won't be gone just moved to a central place. There's an African American museum in Washington now. Put a confederate museum in the heart of Dixie somewhere for the families of the confederacy. It shouldn't be in Washington since it was a war against America treason right?"
40222,"The Castleman statue is poor target for statue removal. The explanatory placques are not. Castleman is represented in riding clothes on Carolina. It represents the good thing he did later in life creating the American Saddlebred Association,. There is nothing military in his attire or his choice of mount. The descriptive placques make the connection to his Confederate affiliation earlier in his life, and barely mention his true contribution. The horse industry has been a blessing to the state. It is celebrated in the Horse Park in Lexington. Perhaps that would be the appropriate location for this lovely statue, but where it stands today is a part of life in Louisville. Perhaps changing the descriptive wording would suffice to be an appropriate concession."
40047,"I grew up in the south end of Jefferson county. I think it's a shame what we are doing with our historical statues in the county, state and country. These statues are historical only nothing to do with slavery that happened several hundred years ago All the talk is about black slavery, nothing has been said about white slavery. If we start to remove our history we should also remove, the Lincoln statue, the George Rogers Clark statue, the King Louie statue, and so on so on. All these figures had slaves or is slavery related. When will this stop. Again this action is driven my a minority amount of people and as usual the majority sit and don't react. "
40229,Stop removing history in order to push a political agenda from the side of sore losers. These statues did not become an issue until Trump won. What if hillary had won? Would we then be removing memorials to ali or king? Keep current polorized radical groups like antifa hands off our nations history.
40272,"These statues have been here in Kentucky for years , I do not see these statues as being racist, I see the statues as being a part of our past ,and I see a bunch of people trying to bully, and shame the government, into doing what they want. The same people are causing riots ,and destroying property everywhere, and they are your true racist people. They are trying to change history over what the Civil War was about, Grant owned slaves ,president Lincoln.. his wife's family owned slaves, blacks own slaves. I do not believe anyone thinks that slavery was a good thing, but to try to change history ,and make the Civil War all about slavery when it wasn't, is so wrong, go back ,and read the old history books ..read the old letters ,that was written by the soldiers. Lincoln was going to let slavery be in the South, and in the North, he was wanting to stop it from going out west. Just go back ,and read it before it's too late !! because they are changing history so fast, if these statues in Kentucky ,had to do with slavery, ,and a major part of the Civil War why was it after the civil War the kentuckians that fought for the Confederacy,  was called orphans ...they were not allowed to come back to Kentucky. But once again... everything is being turned around to be one-sided ,when there's no truth to it. So you as the government are going to go on allowing !! people to bully!! you ,and other people to get what they want, and try to change history, and erase it. "
40229,"These monuments are a parts of our history, they show how this country was founded. The people wanting them removed are as much a racis, and bigot, and bully's. This needs to stop."
40245,"We need to remove ""all"" art and symbols of  hatred, racism, and bigotry from our public spaces. Start with the Castleman statue at Cherokee Triangle...after a 104 years it's time to go. Castleman was not a slave owner, but he fought for the Confederacy since there were no ""other"" reasons to why one would have joined the Confederate cause other than to defend the institution of slavery...his statue must go. None of his achievements and contributions to our city and the Commonwealth after the Civil War matter, so take it down! 

Also let us remove the memorial statue of Thomas Jefferson, one of our country's Founding Fathers, in front of Metro Hall. He is a well documented racist, misogynist, and slave owner who's image does not deserve to be displayed and honored in a public place. We probably need to change the name of the county as well...minorities probably find the name ""Jefferson"" offensive.

Don't stop there...also residing at Metro Hall is the statute of King Louis XVI. He needs to be removed! The King, who our beloved city is named in honor of, was a huge bigot and racist. In 1777 he signed a royal decree, the Police des Noirs, effectively removing all Africans and those of African decent from France except for those that were legally owned slaves by the French aristocracy. French culture of the 18th century were not fans of diversity and multiculturalism. Get rid of the statue and let us change the name of the city too...again, some people ""may"" find the name ""Louis"" offensive.

Last Spring Mayor Fischer in a speech before the Confederate Statue to memorialize the dead at UofL before its removal to Brandenburg, Ky, said that Louisville is a ""compassionate forward looking city"" and has no place for statues and symbols that are or may be perceived as racist and supportive of past institutions that promote or revere bigotry, slavery, and all forms of racism and hatred. 

God knows that ""Race, Gender, and Class"" issues should be the top priority for the city! Let's admit it, taking down the Confederate memorial obelisk at UoL and 3rd St has improved so many lives for the better. So Mayor Fischer get to work in making Louisville a more ""compassionate and forward looking city"" and get those ""offensive"" statues and any other symbols of hatred, racism, and bigotry removed from public lands!  "
40241,"Against removal, we can't  change history.  Why is this a big issue now.  Removal will not be a solution.  It is something for the left to attack."
40272,"I do not understand what removing statues or anything relating to the Civil War has to do with race relations today.  Many of those statues were made and erected by private funds, not local, state, or federal monies, over 80 to 130 years ago. Why did no one complain at that time? Many of those statues were erected to honor those who served, some of whom were young boys forced into service when a standing army (the Union army as well) came through the farmlands of this country. Many of those boys and men were threatened with death if they did not leave and serve. What were they to do? If those monuments are to be removed, then any statue, plaque, tribute, or written document referring to slavery must be removed as well.  That means anything that represents the underground railroad, the Emancipation Proclamation document, or the Civil Rights movement must go as well. You can not have it one way. After all of the statues are removed what is next? Are those behind this movement going to demand the razing of the homes of Thomas Jefferson and George Washington because they were slave owners? What about removing the Lincoln Memorial (after all, he was the President during the Civil War).  After doing this what is next? Are those protesting about slavery today going to demand that all the schools and universities across America remove any books relating to slavery and burn them in the streets? Then will these same people march to the DAR and SAR and have any records of those who served during the Revolutionary War and who owned slaves be destroyed? What happened 150 years ago has nothing to do with race relations today, it is just an excuse to blame someone or some event for not addressing the real problems in America today. The Emancipation Proclamation, the Civil Rights Act of the 1960's, and forced busing across the United States during the 1970's, were some of the opportunities given to minorities to give them the same  rights as whites. Something else that busing did for minorities was to show them that there was a life different from what they were experiencing in their neighborhoods when they rode through the white neighborhoods.
I am a baby boomer and have lived through the 60's and 70's and have noticed that minorities have come a long way and have been given the same opportunities that I had to become a productive member of society through hard work and striving to achieve something in this life, if they want to put forth the effort. The church has not solved racial tensions and the schools can not solve these problems. The government has not achieved this goal either.  Until the basic family unit does what they are supposed to do in raising their children to be responsible for their actions and not blame someone or society for their problems nothing will ever change.  Until children are taught to respect authority figures, are given social structure, and a value system nothing to do with racial problems in our society will be solved. Those things that remind us of the Civil War or slavery 150 years ago have nothing  to do with today."
47150,"This is rediculous, until it started getting press no one was offended. Most of these statues were errected to honor the courage, intelligence and commitment shown by these individuals, not slavery, bigotry or racism. These men were forced to make decisions in a war where brothers were fighting brothers and fathers were fighting sons. Presidents, Generals, heros and leaders being immortalized has NOTHING to do with race. Some people just need to find a hobby"
40222-5561,The monuments that are the subject of this review are street art that adds to the beauty of the city and are only objectionable to a few ignorant activists. Removing them to appease the activists would be a travesty. Don't waste our tax dollars moving or destroying these monuments!
40212,"Hi i think the statues should stay were they are they are a part of history and been here all this time and never hurt a thing
if they are moved is the history books going to be reworded too...."
40220,"I am NOT in favor of removing historical statues in our city.
They are ART-!!!!
Change the wording on the plaques if u wish.
Truly, how does a statue change the lives of people in our city.
A statue does not make the statement that Louisville is racist, in my opinion. 
I believe that Louisville is a progressive city that welcomes everyone.
If Louisvillians feel our city is racist, then there is a deeper concern to review than our statues.
Add more statues to balance the history in our city.
If we remove statues, what is next? Religious symbolism?"
40067,"We are going to take down statues to keep from offending people. Why don't we change the name of Muhammad Ali center to Cassius Clay draft dodger stadium?? I'm appalled at the people who are being so he'll bent on rewriting history!!! WHY!!! It's history!!!!
"
40223,Please leave our statues alone.  Removing them will not erase or change our history.  Remembering the past is crucial to the future.  The statues give us wonderful teaching opportunities outside the classroom.  Not all people have access or desire to go to a museum.  Moving them would be a mistake.  You cannot sanitize our history by simply moving statues.  It is wrong.  History should not be sanitized.  It must be remembered so the same mistakes will be avoided in the future.  Please don't remove part of our southern heritage.
47265,"It is a part of our history. All of OUR's!! 
No one can change our past, and therefore should not change where statues are placed due to sensitive feelings. Those people were not even there to see or witness those hard times. "
40205,"The statue honoring General Castleman represents his dedication to the parks. He is in civilian riding clothes. The statue does not celebrate the Confederacy in any form. It is a beautiful work of art. Please, please let it stand !
My family has lived in the Highlands for 4 generations. I do not remember my family celebrating his memory for any other reason, than our park system. Thank you ! Anne C Stivers RN"
40213,"Either leave Confederate Statues standing to honor all of our past and history, OR TAKE DOWN ALL! "
40214,"Why can't we build a Historical Museum in either Frankfort, Lexington or Louisville and each community out in the state can volunteer the statues in their town to be placed in this museum . Personally , I don't think they should've removed any Civil War statues . The Civil
Was  was about States Rights not slavery . It is our history and no one can change that and I think the statues are beautiful art work , but to appease everyone , instead of spending money to move their statues somewhere else ,where they are accepted for the time being , let's build a museum that contains the statues plus other historical mementos of the time in one place. No one is made to go but I certainly would visit it. Besides we would be the ONLY STATE that one could see all this in one place . It would make money for the state ... if offended black persons don't want to go , so be it , but it is part of their history also , whether or not they want to acknowledge that . There are so many artifacts besides the statues that could go in the museum ...for everyone to learn more about who we are and where we came from "
40229,"The statues being hailed as ""racist"" are simply statues of historical figures. They do not depict any specific racist or violent activity or action. Anyone who claims these statues are symbols of racism or bigotry are transferring their own racism and bigotry onto the statue and giving it a symbolism that was never intended. Kentuckians need to embrace our collective history and embrace the motto ""united we stand"".  Most Kentuckians do not agree with the removing of historical statues and believe giving in to the few self-elevated, misguided and uneducated individuals whose goal is to create disharmony and racial division is the beginning of a social and moral decline that will be irreversible. If we want to truly end racism and division in our culture all people's must see themselves and others as equal. Organizations such as the NAACP, colleges that do not allow Caucasians, and ""black only"" facilities are what need to be eradicated. All human beings should be seen as simply human, regardless of skin color, historical position, or current self-imposed position. Art is to be enjoyed by all. Where will this end? Irish-Americans demanding the removal of all hand-hewn fencing built by Irish slaves because they believe it to be offensive? Latin-Americans demanding the removal of all paintings depicting anything they feel to be degrading? Young women demanding the destruction of all advertising depicting women weighing less than them be ause it creates a poor self-image? Honestly, the fact that we are even having a social discussion about this is absolutely rediculous!! The statues have been here for hundreds of years and should remain for hundreds more!"
40299,"Confederate monuments, flags and memorabilia have no place in public places anywhere in the United States that is local, state or federally funded. These items glorify traitors to the United States of America. They were put up mostly in the Jim Crow era as a backlash to the freedom of slaves in America and are as offensive to African Americans as statues of Hitler and his Nazis are to survivors and descendants of survivors of the Holocaust. Are there statues of Hitler and his cronies in Germany? Then why do we have statues and flags honoring the traitors to the United States of America in this country who fought to perpetuate the American Holocaust? Take them ALL down and re-purpose the materials they were made of. NOW!"
40205,"I urge the Commission to keep the John B. Castleman statue  at  it's original location. Those calling for its removal have correctly pointed out that he served in the Confederate Army during the Civil War. However once his citizenship rights were restored he devoted the rest of his long life to this city, the Commonwealth and the nation. Confederate Veteran Magazine, which was the major organ for the ""Lost Cause"" in the Jim Crow era is an excellent source for identifying Confederate monuments. This source makes no mention of the 1913 dedication of the civic monument to Castleman. In many ways Castleman was Louisville's ""Atticus Finch"" during the Jim Crow era. In 1887 he, with a few hundred local militia, prevented a white mob numbering nearly 10,000 from dragging two African American inmates from the city jail and lynching them for the brutal murder of a young white girl. In 1916 the ""Colored Minister's Association"" of Louisville petitioned the city for the construction of ""Colored"" parks in their neighborhoods. Castleman backed them to the hilt stating in the Courier Journal that the city had shamefully neglected the recreational needs of black citizens. Prior to this request ""Colored"" families had to travel to the other side of the city to frequent public parks. A eulogy from a local black educator published in the C-J on 26 May 1918 after Castleman's death praised him as the greatest friend and benefactor the ""Colored people' of Louisville ever had. it is interesting to note that he received no eulogy in Confederate Veteran Magazine. i am convinced this was the result of Castleman's public declaration that white soldiers who enlisted to fight in WW I were duty bound to salute black officers they passed on the streets of Louisville. Castleman was a transitional figure between paternalist masters like Washington and Jefferson and the Bradens of the Civil Rights era. It would be a grave injustice to remove a monument to a man who treated former slaves with respect and dignity. A man who served as their protector and benefactor. A man who stood against violence and for racial justice."
40205,"I may or may not be present at the hearing tomorrow so my thoughts are as follows .
First, I am retired senior staff to the Louisville Landmarks Commission and have forty years of public service, predominantly in historic preservation but also inner city neighborhood redevelopment beginning in 1977 when I went to work for Butchertown Neighborhood Government. For thirty years I made my home in south Old Louisville , the ""03"", one of the poorest yet most racially diverse portions of our city.  I did this consciously, having been born to immigrant parents in the deep segregated south of Louisiana.  My mother was a Holocaust survivor who also helped free her parents from Nazis and who as a teenager smuggled gold to England on her Nazi-mandated journeys to Germany from England during the war.  The rest of my family
Perished in the camps or were shot to death in their beds.  My grandparents survived Kristallnacht - I am no stranger to racist immoral history.
I also do not believe history should be altered in all cases as pertains to
Monuments, houses, public buildings, graveyards ,etc.  I found the ""final solution"" to the location of our own Confederate monument on Third St to be an ill-disguised attempt at removing racist symbols by simply relocating said racist symbol to  where it continues today......as a racist symbol.
Because the Speed-a family of slave holders with a rather important homestead preserved in all of its accuracy - including its slave history.  Disingenuous at best, ironic at most, given the incredibly educating no punches pulled full of racial uncomfortableness contained with its current exhibition - which should be on permanent display IMO someplace like Quinn Chapel, an important historic site left to molder at Ninth and Chestnut. Talk about irony and The Great Divide........ instead of taking the monument and seeking artistic deconstruction and reinterpretation in a public spot at a public institution- we shipped it elsewhere and think our hands are clean .  Far better to have made it part of the extensive historic display of African American history on site.  But nobody asked my opinion.
I also ask you to interpret the meaning of the two statues mounted at Metro Hall.  The Jefferson Monument was sculpted by Moses Ezekiel.  A Jew who served proudly in the Confederate army, and was the first Jew to graduate from VMI.  HHe resided in Rome and sculpted Confederate memorials including the one in Arlington he requested burial beneath .  Our Louis XVI statue was a rejected closeted work commissioned by his daughter Marie-Therese for her father, who was beheaded for treason along with his let them eat cake wife Marie Antoinette .  France didn't want this relic of the revolution and shipped it to us.  Louis' Ville?
As far as Castleman is concerned the history is murky.  In his time securing separate recreational facilities for blacks was likely a progressive stance.  Having grown up in a southern town where pavement literally ended at black streets where shanties stood directly behind white palatial homes - systemic racism in zoning and eating and transportation and life in general still exists today.  Better to reinterpret Castlemans history to include a more comprehensive analysis ( like the York sculpture on the Belvedere), than remove him.  I don't share that same opinion on Jim Crow era memorials designed to glorify a dead cause but I don't think cleansing the city of every vestige of its undeniable history is advisable .  My own grandmother Johanna Davidsohn Rosendahl, who had died by the time I was fifteen, pulled no punches informing me in the
Most brutal of language, what she and
My mother  and my family endured under Hitler.  My mother spoke at high schools when I was a student and even endured a trip back to Düsseldorf with me so I could witness her story through my own eyes .  Ground Zero
For Kristallnacht - Düsseldorf has not hidden this history but has displayed it openly in its own Holocaust museum.  
Recently I went to see the exhibit in Chicago called Then They Came For Me, a brilliant and painful lesson about the interment of Japanese Americans during World War 2.  This
Country shares little glory in human kindness even into this century.  The fascination with inanimate objects over corrective measures to truly eradicate racism in this country amazes me.
Especially at a time when we as a country are at our most racially diverse .  We still enforce housing segregation by our zoning laws and inflict terrible punishments upon the working poor by creating jobs in places far away
From low income housing and with lousy transit .
So.  
Personally I want this committee to address as well the disappearance of the Southern
Exposition fountain from Ft Nelson Park and the tornado sculpture from Main Street.  Last I saw the fountain - a rare piece some of us went to great pains to
Locate and salvage, in a parking lot on Seventh St Rd.  Really??????"
40217,"Thank you for providing a forum for dialogue. It is a difficult environment to attempt to defend monuments related to the Confedrarcy in light if the events in Charlottesville. I condemn in the strongest terms all hate groups, and it is unfortunate that they have used monuments to rally around.  That in itself I understand can be a reason for removal. However, my hope is that we can look beyond extremists. Yes, I understand that these monuments can be perceived as racist in our 21st century eyes.  However, let us please judge these in context. Any white man from KY or IN if he was born in the 1800's  would be considered a racist in today's light. They did not have the luxury of 150 years of hindsight as we do now.  Many who chose to fight for the Confederacy had to make a very difficult decision for those times in a manner none of us can understand because we did not live in that time.  I pray our descendants 150 years from now will be less judgmental than we are being to our ancestors from 150 years ago.  I stand in support of the preservation of historical monuments and certainly support any added context the city feels is needed.  Regardless, whatever decision is made I pray for lawful means of removal. All forms of vandalism must be discouraged and rigorously prosecuted. Thank you for allowing opinions to be heard."
40178,"These statues, that symbolizes a dark period of our history, need to be removed.  I could relate, but certainly not fully understand, to individuals hatred of these items.  We certainly don't want them destroyed, but out of the public's eye and placed in a more appropriate place that represent history, such as a museum.  It's disheartening, that politicians can only play to both sides without really making a statement.  I don't want symbols of hatred in my state capitol or any other place where I might take my family."
40205,"I feel it's quite a stretch to call the Castleman statue a Confederate Monument. He's not wearing a military uniform and if he was, it could very well have been a US one. The statue is on the National Register of Historic Places and is  one of the most beautiful intersections in the city! Castleman was forgiven by the POTUS and served honorably for the US in the Spanish American war. Will history and future generations forgive you, as the president did Castleman, if you tear it down?
 Thank you for letting me voice my opinion. 
Alan Usher"
40223,"George Prentice (1800-1870) was one of the biggest bigot and racist in this towns history. He was anti-foreigners, anti-catholic, pro-slavery, anti-reconstruction and a strong member of the Know-Nothing Party. His rhetoric and inflammatory writing in the paper is given credit for the Bloody Monday riots in 1855 which took the lives of many Louisvillians. How a statue was ever made of him in the first place,I can't imagine. Even the Courier-Journal, of which he was editor, didn't want it as they moved it from the Courier-Jornal to the Library where it now stands."
40204,"Many of you have the wrong idea about why the Castleman statue was placed in the round-about at Cherokee Road and Cherokee Parkway.  It was not to honor a Civil War major – notice the figure is not in uniform.  It was to honor the man (and his beloved horse, American Saddle Bred Carolina) who established the Board of Parks Commissioners and served as its president for many years.  He is credited with securing the property for Cherokee Park and oversaw its development.  He rode Carolina through the park almost every day.  He also founded the American Saddle Breeders Association and was its president for 28 years.  The statue was intended to show Castleman on Carolina overlooking the entrance to the park he loved, Cherokee Park.  Change the marker to reflect the purpose of the statue.  Do not remove the statue. 

As for the issue that he was a racist and segregationist, we are not excusing him. But we remember that many people of that era (and sadly even today) were of the same ilk; and even so, he made it possible for Blacks to gather in the parks without retribution from the whites who did not want them in “their” parks.   As an officer in the U.S. Army when Southerners disputed having African Americans in their ranks, General Castleman is quoted as saying, ""I unhesitatingly say that I will at any time salute an officer, superior or inferior, who salutes me, without regard to the color of his skin. The regulations and laws, and the fundamentals of courtesy and discipline, upon which these regulations and laws are based, prescribe this. It is no time to stand against them. I want to urge every soldier to be a soldier in the full sense of the term. We are at war, and soldiers are under the rules of the American army. We are all one under the flag. We salute the rank, not the individual.” [Quote from Albert Lea Evening Tribune]

"
40205,"I think each item of public art must be evaluated on a case by case basis. It is unreasonable to require that we eliminate the visage of any and all persons who had any connection to the Confederacy or who today we would regard as racist or segregationist without consideration of positive contributions they may have made to our community, our state or our nation. 

In particular, I don't think the statue of General Castleman in the Cherokee Triangle should come down. Castleman, who was a founder of the American Saddlebred Horse Association, is depicted in equestrian attire. While he did serve in the Confederate army and was imprisoned for his actions, he received a presidential pardon and later served with distinction as a general in the US army during the Spanish American War. He was instrumental in the founding of our public (now integrated) parks system.
"
40205,"By no sane standard can the Castleman statue ""be interpreted to be honoring bigotry, racism, and/or slavery"".  It is a fine work which suits its setting, and I hope it will be left in situ.

"
40241,"Around the end of Reconstruction in later 1800s and early 1900s, Jim Crow laws were passed to codify racial segregation, making discrimination the ""law of the land"". Statues and monuments celebrating the Civil War including past and current leaders, erected during this time period, should receive automatic consideration for removal. Having established a first pass list, other mitigating factors may be considered, such as the person's contribution to society in general. Simply saying this person supported segregation may not be reason enough since it was generally supported by voters (which did not then include blacks). Some should probably be melted down, as evil. Others might find a place in museums, cemeteries or private hands."
40207,"Castleman's statue is by no stretch of the imagination a monument to the Confederacy.  He is not depicted in uniform, but astride his favorite horse.  The statue recognizes his role as long-time president of the American Saddlebred Horse Assoc.; and its location on Cherokee Parkway honors his leadership of this city's park system for many years.  His other service includes reviving the Louisville Legion in 1878, serving two hitches as Adjutant-General of Kentucky (the second tour instrumental in preventing a civil war in Kentucky in 1900 over a disputed gubernatorial election), and from 1898 to 1900 as first a Colonel and then Brigadier General in the U.S. Army during the Spanish-American War. In this role he commanded an Army regiment in Puerto Rico, gaining the respect and appreciation of the Puerto Ricans in his geographic area of command.  His extensive contributions to city, state, and nation far outweigh his 2 years as a Confederate soldier.  See his memoir, ACTIVE SERVICE (aptly titled), in which he wrote in italics ""Public service is every man's duty.""  As the Washington Post editorial board thoughtfully observed on August 17:  ""For purposes of public memorialization, there is a distinction between people who partook of their era's moral flaws and those whose primary claim to fame is to have betrayed their country with the ultimate goal of making it impossible for slavery ever to be abolished in roughly half of the United States.""  John Castleman has many claims to fame.  (See his entry in The Kentucky Encyclopedia, University Press of Kentucky, 1992)."
40241,"My wife and I grew up in Cleveland, OH, but we have lived in Louisville since 1972. Over the years we have learned more about Louisville and why it ""joined the Confederacy"" even as the Union Army held tightly to Louisville and most of the state. "
40206,"     The charge is difficult to fathom, since it doesn't indicate by whom a piece of artwork can be interpreted as honoring bigotry.  Obviously, Jefferson was a slaveholder--does his statue, therefore, prima facie establish the honoring of bigotry?  Similarly Locust Grove includes slave quarters, and its very existence clearly honors bigotry, racism and/or slavery.  However, assuming without deciding that the real agenda behind this unintelligible charge is to get rid of General Castleman's statue, I believe you should consider the purported purpose of the statute on Cherokee Parkway, sloping down to Cherokee Park (since, of course ""Willow Park"" is an artificial designation for that portion of Cherokee Park cut off from the rest of the park when Alt US 60 was created).  Did General Castleman have something to do with Cherokee Park?  Was the impetus for the statue this, rather than his service as a Confederate major during the Civil War?  Unless there is incontrovertible evidence the statue was erected principally to honor his Confederate military service, there doesn't seem to be a basis for concluding honoring bigotry is the raison d'etre for the statue.  "
40272,"Yes history is history, but have large reminder of bad history is a constant reminder of things. Just because some people don't know the meaning an history behind something's doesn't make it right just make it subtle. You wouldn't have a statue of a slave owner wiping a slave, but just because you take the slave away an just a statue of a slave owner didn't change anything the effect it just toned it down. People just see a statue of a man an just put good things they did  on sign, just to openly offend ppl. But if you are willing to erect a sculpture an put slave owner,bigot,or anything else an have it put up in the city. Don't hide the truth in order to not openly offend, the sculpture,paintings,ect.., are openly offensive. Would you put a sculpture or painting that represents KY,of a child molester, that did many good things for the city? Would you debut on well we still want him remembered for all the good things he did so we will put his statue up in the capital an just not put the bad things on sign. History is not forgotten ,just don't need a 20ft. Or 12x20 reminder of something's."
40202," I wanted to voice my support for keeping the Castleman statue in the Cherokee Triangle. This is a statute is not honoring General Castleman for serving in the Confederacy or his segregationist beliefs but rather his instrumental role with Saddlebreds and his leadership in establishing Louisville's park system. We need to look at his life in totality and that he was a man of his time complete with warts and virtues. Use this statue to educate all of us on the the good and bad of,this man and of his times."
40208,"I think the statues should stay.the reasoning is this.    They serve this generation as a  reminder, how Man has treated another Man.     Each race on this planet has been a Slave to another race.    Jews, Christians, were slaves that built the Pyramids.  No one wants to take  them down.    Without these reminders, I am sure Man will repeat a lot them.   "
40217,"I am totally opposed to moving art saving it is racist etc.  History should not be changed or altered to satisfy possible hurt feelings,  History good or bad is still history.  The South was a part of our country.  Americans have a right to their history.  Men and women gave their lives to preserve what they believe in. Hiding history does not change it.  If Brandenburg ends up with our Louisville history, I will be visiting the art and telling Brandenburg I am proud of them.  Thank you for your kind consideration,"
40206,"
I want to move the confederate monuments. 
I propose a quiz for those who think  that this would be ""destroying our history""

Q . How many men from KY fought in the  Civil War?   A: 120,000
Q.  How many men fought for the South?   A:  30,000
Q:  Where are the memorials for the 90,000 men who fought for the Union.  They were brave and fought well too
Q:  When were the Confederate monuments built?  A:  After 1900 
Q:  Why were they built during the establishment of Jim Crow laws?
 
I expect a lot of folks would flunk this quiz

I am a VietNam vet who did my duty without believing the war was just.  My Great grandfather fought for the Confederate side all the way through the war. He told his family he had fought for the wrong side.  Where are the memorials that represent this part of our history?

Sincerely
Kyle Ellison
 "
40204,"Please leave the Castleman statue alone.  It is not a monument to the Confederacy or a symbol of White Supremacy.  Let's all stop these knee jerk responses and uninformed ideas/opinions.  How about working together to help elderly neighbors, holding a door open for others, stop staring at your phone instead of the people around you?  Having some consideration for your fellow human being would make a lot more sense than taking down a statue that has stood in the same location for 100 years and doesn't even represent what half of the uninformed thinks it represents.  Thanks"
40204,"If you will please take some time and look more deeply into the history of John Castleman, you find a man that had a very positive and material impact on the city of Louisville. He was the parks commissioner for 25 years and was instrumental in creating the entire park system for Louisville.  He founded the American Saddlebred Horse Association, making it the first single breed horse association in the United States, and it was originally located in Louisville, Kentucky. In 1878, he created the Louisville Legion, which was one of the best local military bodies in the United States.  Castleman was the brigadier general of The Louisville Legion and volunteered for service in the US Army during the Spanish-American War and in Puerto Rico, bringing great pride and honor to Louisville. He established a very successful insurance company called the Royal Insurance Company, providing jobs and bringing commerce to Louisville. In 1905, he helped establish the Fusionist Party, an anti-corruption political party, in Louisville. 

The problem with the statue is not the statue or the man's history, but it is the plaques that glorify his short time (~4 years) as a confederate rebel soldier. THE SOLUTION IS TO CHANGE THE PLAQUES.  A new plaque needs to be created that highlights the great things he did for Louisville Ky.  It could mention his time as a young confederate soldier, but also mention how he was pardoned by Presidents Lincoln and Johnson for his crimes.  Then, go deeper into the great accomplishments he did to advance Louisville as a leading city during his lifetime. 

Please don't have blinders on and get caught up with this whirlwind of tearing down statues to appease a small group of people that don't ready history. *This is not a statue that depicts a confederate soldier.* He is wearing equestrian clothes riding his favorite horse welcoming people into Louisville's great park system.  All you need to do is to change the plaques to correctly highlight his significant achievements for our fine city.

Thank you.
"
40207,"White-washing history does not change it.  Hiding monuments does not change who we are.  Both merely serve to continue the dumbing-down of present and future generations.  Who benefits from that?  We are already a society that knows next to nothing about the civil war in particular and history in general.  My understanding of the objection to the statute of John Breckinridge Castleman is that he fought for the CSA.  So what?  Two of my great-great grandfathers did as well.  Am I too to be banned from Louisville?  You realize he also accomplished a great deal for the city as well, do you not.  But, even if he didn't, what offends about his monument (or any of the others)?  Is it the City's position that African Americans are so weak and so infantile in their emotions that a statue causes them harm?  If there is a monument somewhere in this city to a person with whom I disagree (measured by today's standards as opposed to the time in which that person lived), are you willing to destroy that for me?  Let's start with Louis XVI.  I find his disdain for both the common people and the concept of liberty offensive.  Take down the statue.  It offends me.  I can barely sleep at nights knowing it is there.  In fact, change the name of the city - that too is offensive.

Can you not see how ridiculous this whole conversation is?  Demolition of culture is a dangerous game to play.  You have no idea where this is going to go and how soon your totems are going to come down too.
"
40014,"Currently the focus is on erasing our history by removing Confederate monuments and statues associated with the Civil War. It seems that many liberals and Blacks are obsessed with this idea. What happens when our American Indians start paying closer attention to their history and how their ancestors were treated in the 1860's during the presidency of Lincoln? What happens when the 'First Americans' start clamoring for removal of statutes and monuments dedicated to Lincoln? Where does it end? Will Ford Motor Co. drop the popular name of their flagship marque?

It can be pointed out that many of our great leaders were guilty of suppression and discrimination against minorities. Here's one example:

Lincoln: No Hero to Native Americans
by Sherry Salway Black MAGAZINE

The Emancipation Proclamation was in many ways a tremendous step forward for human rights, but it didn’t bring any new rights to Native Americans.

In fact, Abraham Lincoln is not seen as much of a hero at all among many American Indian tribes and Native peoples of the United States, as the majority of his policies proved to be detrimental to them. For instance, the Homestead Act and the Pacific Railway Act of 1862 helped precipitate the construction of the transcontinental railroad, which led to the significant loss of land and natural resources, as well as the loss of lifestyle and culture, for many tribal people. In addition, rampant corruption in the Indian Office, the precursor of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, continued unabated throughout Lincoln’s term and well beyond. In many cases, government-appointed Indian agents outright stole resources that were supposed to go to the tribes.

In other cases, the Lincoln administration simply continued to implement discriminatory and damaging policies, like placing Indians on reservations. Beginning in 1863, the Lincoln administration oversaw the removal of the Navajos and the Mescalero Apaches from the New Mexico Territory, forcing the Navajo to march 450 miles to Bosque Redondo—a brutal journey. Eventually, more than 2,000 died before a treaty was signed.

Several massacres of Indians also occurred under Lincoln’s watch. For example, the Dakota War in Minnesota in 1862 led to the hanging of thirty-eight Indian men—303 Indian men had been sentenced to hang, but the others were spared by Lincoln’s pardon. The Sand Creek Massacre in southeastern Colorado in 1864 also resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Cheyenne and Arapaho.

On a more positive note, Pueblo leaders received silver-headed ebony canes in 1863 engraved with Lincoln’s name to symbolize their sovereignty. These canes are still revered and used for ceremonial purposes today.

W. Dale Mason describes Lincoln’s policy toward Native Americans in his essay “The Indian Policy of Abraham Lincoln.” “President Lincoln … continued the policy of all previous presidents of viewing Indian as wards of the government while at the same time negotiating with them as sovereigns,” Mason writes. “He made no revolutionary change in Indian-white relations as he did in black-white relations with the Emancipation Proclamation. While he called for reform of the Indian system in his last two Annual Messages to Congress, he provided no specifics and he continued the policy, already in place, of confining Indians to reservations after negotiating treaties.”

What’s clear is that the Emancipation Proclamation did not end discrimination against Native Americans. There are many wounds that still need to be healed."
40228,"If we make further mistakes by removing Confederate Memorials and Monuments, we are dishonoring all current US veterans. Confederate veterans were made US veterans by act of Congress in 1957, by US Public Law 85-425, Sec 410, approved 23 May 1958. Even without this technical granting of veterans' status to Confederate servicemen, there is still the matter of the expressed intent of many of these monuments, and this intent is often engraved on them. For instance, Louisville's Confederate monument, which was dishonorably and wrongfully removed by Mayor Fischer, had the inscription: ""Rank and File of the Armies of the South."" This clearly means that it was a veterans' memorial, dedicated to enlisted American soldiers. They were indeed American soldiers, and no leader, no cause, and no social condition was remembered on that monument. Its removal was an affront to all veterans, living and passed. Let no more be removed."
40204,I LOVE THE CASTLEMAN STATUE FOR IT'S DIGNIFIED PRESENCE IN OUR AREA.  THIS AREA IS NAMED AFTER HIM; WHY SHOULD WE REMOVE HIS STATUE?   IT WOULD DEVALUE THE AREA TO TAKE IT DOWN AND IT'S A RIDICULOUS ARGUMENT THAT IS BEING MADE.   SO HE SERVED AT AGE 19 IN THE CIVIL WAR.   HE WENT ON TO SERVE AS A GENERAL FOR YEARS IN THE US ARMY AND TO BE THE VISIONARY WHO HELPED MAKE THIS AREA BEAUTIFUL.   HIS GIFTS WERE MANY TO US AND WE SHOULD BE SHOWING OUR APPRECIATION -- NOT TRYING TO HEAP HUMILIATION ON THE MEMORY OF A GOOD MAN.
40204,Castleman is honored for his contribution to Louisville's Park system.  He actually gave us some of his land for parks.  He is not honored for his civil war service; the plaque doesn't even say which side he was on.  Leave it where it is.
40223,"Please do not destroy historical monuments for future generations. The destructive actions of a loud minority is the only narrative that is being given consideration. Keep the monuments, keep historical art. "
40206,"Louisvillians know something now that can’t be unknown.  We can continue the debate, but the reality is that very few knew the name or history of the rider on the beautiful horse statue in Cherokee Triangle until recently. We know now, all of us know that the rider is John B. Castleman, a confederate officer who fought to uphold slavery and later worked to segregate Louisville’s park system.  His statue is on the National Registry of Confederate Monuments where it is celebrated as a symbol of a racist history.  We can no longer sit silent while this racist history and legacy is honored in our public spaces.

The mayor of Lexington, Kentucky, is taking action to remove two Confederate-era monuments from his city's former courthouse. We must demand that Mayor Fisher do the same for our community and take the Castleman statue down. 

Some say, let these statues stand so we can teach our children a better way, but statues like these, like the one in Charlottesville, like those throughout our State and throughout the South, were never meant to teach our children the evil realities of the civil war and of slavery, they were erected to pay homage, to revere the history and the ongoing legacy of white supremacy and to keep it in place.   It is why they are becoming rallying points for white nationalists and Neo-Nazi’s who are working to uphold those same white supremacist values of the confederacy.

This atmosphere which celebrates symbols of slavery, also condones the killing of Black people, the deportation of our immigrant people, the attacks on Muslim people, and anti-semitism.

This is not just about a statue. This is about institutionalized racism in our schools, our housing policies, our criminal justice system and more. We can’t un-know, what we now know.  So, Mayor Fisher and the Public Arts Commission, show some compassion and Take it Down!
"
40206,"Thank you for initiating this review. I'm an artist myself but even I can see that some of these statues and monuments are damaging to our community. Why should we place individuals on a pedestal that have furthered white supremacy and racism? Individuals who fought to preserve slavery? No - there is so much work to do in dismantling white supremacy and the LEAST we can do is remove statues that venerate people whose actions are contrary to what we as a society should applaud. Remove these monuments - like the Castleman Statue near Cherokee Park - and put them in a museum where we can all learn from their mistakes. THEN: commission an artist or artists of color to create a work of art in its place. Give more opportunities to Louisville artists from racial minorities to share their talents with us all.
Thank you for listening. "
40222,"Public art that offends should be viewed comprehensively and not limited to Confederate monuments per se.  The statute of George Prentice prominently sited before our Louisville Public Library should be a candidate for relocation.  Prentice was the editor of the predecessor to the Courier-Journal.  His editorials  supported the American Party, also known as the ""Know-Nothing Party"", during the 1855 Kentucky gubernatorial election railing against Irish and German Catholic immigrants in terms so bigoted and inflammatory it lead to the ""Bloody Monday"" riots in Louisville in which at least 22 were murdered by Know-Nothing mobs.  His racial and cultural bigotry was expressed in terms similar to that of Ian Paisley in northern Ireland during the sixties and seventies.  Prentice also supported the federal government in the Civil War until the Emancipation Proclamation when he threw his editorial support to the Confederacy.   His statute should be returned to the lobby of the Courier-Journal lobby from whence it came as a reminder to the editors and writers of the power for evil(and good) that can result from their work."
40213,"All monuments to the confederacy or to ideas or persons who can be seen as honoring or advocating for bigotry or racism should be brought out of public spaces. These monuments hurt already marginalized people, and parks and traffic circles do not have enough space to properly account for the full historical context of complicated figures from our history who upheld values that we now know to hurtful and immoral.
I support the immediate  removal of all of these monuments and suggest that they be replaced with monuments to abolitionists or with memorials of the innocent victims of Americas deeply unfortunate history of racism, slavery, and genocide (of the native populations of this continent). "
40222,"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/23/opinion/mitch-landrieus-speech-transcript.html  If you copy Mayor Landrieu's speech in New Orleans for every member of COPA, you won't have an excuse for procrastinating any further. The very idea of celebrating someone who actually believed he could OWN another human being is beyond comprehension. Just stop and think about what that means. Confederate statues were put on pedestals to celebrate white supremacy and a Lost Cause.  Confederates were trying to destroy this country.  Suppose they had won? We'd be two countries instead of one. Fortunately they did no, and we are E PLURIBUS UNUM and that's who history belongs to: all the people. Let's try to inspire future generations with statues of people we are proud of--not ones we're too embarrassed to look at.
And we could start with women!
"
40205,"I am in favor of keeping the statue as it is, but changing some wording on the signs. Historic records and articles are clear that Castleman was honored with the statue because of his service to Kentucky and the US government as a  leader in the  Kentucky military and the US military. He is also honored for his determination in helping foster through the Louisville Parks system.
Every day, Louisville residents enjoy the park system, which makes this city special. My wife and I walk in Cherokee Park as a way to enjoy our lives together and to connect with nature.
The sign next to the statue should emphasize his role in the development of the park. I believe leaders should allow historic fact to prevail, not current passion. General Sherman and others made their primary contribution as military leaders in the confederate cause. Castleman was in his early 20s during the Civil War and spent a lifetime building our parks and fighting for the US Military Those are facts and facts should matter. Tearing down a statue of this civic leader will not magically erase racism. It would be a regretted and unwise rash act.

40205,I don't think we should honor someone who wanted to segregate parks.  How will that make our community members feel???  Castleman Statue has got to go!!!!
40214,"What one person  interprets as honoring bigotry, racism or slavery another person can interpret as honoring the many things an individual did as good for a community. Why should we take down statues or other artwork that honor the men of our history because we don't like one thing about them. What if we started banning artwork from artist that were drunks or art from blacks that have paintings that show scenes of slavery?

It was the very citizens of our city which allowed these pieces of artwork to be placed where they are. Are we going to go after the people who voted to put these pieces in place. Are we suggesting that previous members of the Louisville Commission on Public Art (or whatever it was called back then) were racist? Were does it stop?

I believe the Gold Statue on Main Street that shows a man's penis is more harmful to our community then the statues that most people don't even know who they are for.  As an individual who works with sex offenders I am offended that Louisville would allow such a piece of art. However, that is what the first amendment is for. It allows expression of speech whether I agree with the speech or not. However, it also allows others to express their speech even if I don't agree with what they are saying. Therefore, I honor the first amendment. 

And I hope the Louisville Commission on Public Art will continue to honor the men these statues honor and honor the previous citizens of our city and their wishes to honor these men. My hope is the artwork will stay."
40503,"It is absurd to suggest that statues of Confederate veterans honor bigotry, racism and/or slavery.The very question suggests an attempt to inflame passions and further polarize the community over the issue. "
40205,I support removing the Castleman statue. Someone who supported segregating parks should not be honored with a monument in The park. The considerations for removing it morally outweigh those for keeping it. Thank you.
40208,"The John B. Castleman statue has garnered a lot of attention lately, and I really think it's worth it to take it down. There are other ways to acknowledge Castleman's contributions to the surrounding neighborhood and the Louisville parks system (history books, brochures about the park system, etc.), but I think that honoring the man with a statue is a mistake, given his service in the Confederate Army and his effort to keep parks segregated. A statue is not a neutral statement of facts about a historical figure; a statue implicitly honors and affirms the values of the person whom it depicts. In Castleman's case, those values include racism and white supremacy, and honoring those values is unacceptable. I don't want to erase him from history or try to sanitize our complicated past--I just don't want to honor him with a statue. 

I recognize that taking down monuments costs money and that other funding needs in the city may take priority at the moment. However, I'd welcome a transparent, specific, long-term strategy for funding and completing the removal of statues and monuments that honor white supremacists in what is supposed to be a Compassionate City. I imagine that many people would contribute donations to the cause if they had the opportunity. Thank you for receiving public comments about this matter. "
40205,"As a highlands resident, I am greatly disturbed that the statue I drive by on a near daily basis was erected to honor someone who fought against our country, for the preservation of slavery, and later championed segregation of our parks. There are so many other wonderful ways that we could use that space. please remove the Castleman statue, and involve citizens of the neighborhood on what should be erected in it's stead. I will judge my councilman and mayor on the results of this decision."
40205,"The statue of George D. Prentice in front of the Main Library should be removed for his role in the Bloody Monday Riots. 

 http://filsonhistorical.org/george-d-prentice/"
40204," I think it is a mistake to confuse the Castleman Statue with Confederate War Monuments.  The key question is, ""Would this statue be here if there had never been a civil war?""  In the case of the Castleman Statue, the answer is clearly, ""Yes"".  The statue was not erected to commemorate, in any way, Castleman's time as a CSA officer.  The statue is about Castleman's service in establishing the parks.  "
40204," I want to urge the Commission in the strongest possible terms to retain the Castleman statue in its present  location.  My first point is that those who argue the statue should be removed are purposefully misrepresenting statue's origin and intent.   The rider in the statue is wearing civilian clothing, riding a saddlebred horse that lived at the turn of the century,  and the work of art itself in no way references the Civil War.  Instead it was commissioned to  very appropriately to commemorate Castleman's significant contributions to Louisville civic society in the late 1800s and early 1900s, including the establishment of our wonderful park system, which he oversaw as superintendent for many years. For the Mira reason alone that this is not in anyway a ""civil war statue"", it's removal should not even be considered.  Furthermore, as has been pointed out by many, general Castleman played other major roles in society including  notable event in the history of the commonwealth of Kentucky, in which he helped to preserve civil government at a time when a disputed gubernatorial election  threatened the very democracy of our commonwealth.  Also, Caatlwman'a  contribution to the establishment of the American Saddlebred Horse Association was  uniquely significant. Even more significantly, is an argument that has not been articulated to any significant degree, and that is  how wrong it would be to remove a significant work of art.  I would remind the commission that you are an ARTS commission.   The statue actually  has major artistic significance as one of the first, perhaps the first equestrian statue in which the horse is in trot, on two feet only. Prior to that, no artist had been able to execute a statue with a horse on 2 feet, which is the natural position of a horse in its natural gate, the trot.  As an arts commission, you would be derelict in your duty to allow removal of such a significant statue."
47281,"Leave the statues/painting/art work alone. Keep them in place. People visit your fine city to look at these exhibits!  Let them stay were they were erected/painted.

The other problem you are having is way too much graffiti on buildings throughout your wonderful city..  This is not art work.

Thanks"
,"I think your decisions are already made based on political correctness but I still hope you will consider this.  I can't go to the public meetings because being white, some people would label me a raceist or something no matter what I say.  That being said, I know the white supremists are idiots, the kkk dangerous cultists and slavery an archiac, evil way of life so please don't make preconceived decisions.  If you set up rules for public art, everything must go.  Many of our founding fathers had slaves or owned the ships that brought them.  Our local heroes, Lewis and the Clarks had slaves (and treated them badly). Many of the union soldiers went on to put down the Indians (Custer, Sheridan, etc.)  Sherman is a war criminal in today's light.  Grant was run out of office. Lincoln ran roughshod over the constitution at will.  Even the Revends King and Coleman had histories.  So no one is qualified to remain or they all are.  Look at the overall context of a life and decide.  But PUBLISH THE STANDARDS FIRST SO WE WILL NO IT IS NOT JUST EXPEDIANCE."
40205,"Folks, we should move the statue of Castleman to a private museum, please do not spend another $8200.00 removing paint, why not use that to transport him out of  the Highlands, Now people say were washing history, well lets look at Castleman's history, He fought on Confederate side and wanted to destroy Chicago, How about all the Afro/Americans who died in the Civil War, Do you think that they would want this statue in their town. Plus Ky was on the Union side not Confederate side, why honor anyone who  was on the Confederate side and wanted to continue slavery.  , Please do not send this statue to a southern town, like you did with our last statue problem, that is just kicking the problem down the road, If a history museum wants him and they will keep inside  no problem, ship it to them otherwise lets just put him in storage and throw away the key!!!!"
40204,"I am writing with concern about the efforts to remove the statue of General Castleman from Cherokee Parkway.  The erection of this statue had nothing to do with his service in the Civil War.  Yes, he was a Confederate officer, and later a Brigadier General in the US Army.  His post civil war activities had much to do with reconciliation.  See the attached research done by Peter Morrin, former Director of the Speed Museum.

The statue was erected to commemorate Castleman’s service to the community, and should be revered as such.

Efforts to remove the statue are a misguided response to the events in Charlottesville.  If the fact that he had been a Confederate officer is objectionable (and it is), change the historical placque.

GENERAL CASTLEMAN STATUE
The Castleman statue is artistically and culturally significant, and should not be moved.   My perspective is that of a preservationist and an art historian. I think that there are strong reasons for the sculpture remaining in its original location surrounded by buildings of the same period.  Not only is the context important, but the sculpture itself is distinguished. When the sculpture was first proposed in 1910, the stated purpose was to honor Castleman by erecting “an equestrian statue of him in one of the parks of the city, in commemoration of the great service given by the General in the establishment of the Louisville Park system. “  Gen. Castleman was recognized by many at the time as the father of the Louisville park system.  When the sculpture was dedicated in 1913, he was said to be honored because “his foresight and judgment have been rare assets in obtaining tracts of land to complete and shape out the different parks and the beauty of the system as a whole is a splendid memorial to his artistic sense and devotion.”   While Castleman was revered by the establishment business community in his lifetime, it is as much the park system itself that is honored as is the man.   Louisvillians were extremely proud of the parks created in the in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and the symbolic language of the day called for statuary, the more magnificent the better. No right-thinking person wants to be a party to encouraging racism or perpetuating symbols of prejudice.  There are certainly underlying meanings to the sculpture, and the recognition bestowed on Castleman, a flawed character at best, is no doubt misplaced, but the sculpture is not intrinsically about glorifying him or  the “Lost Cause” or perpetuating its racist ideologies and its determination to perpetuate slavery.  It is not a Confederate monument.
The implicit themes of the sculpture reference Louisville’s eagerness to be nationally identified as a place of reconciliation between North and South and the ‘City Beautiful’ movement. Why does the sculpture exist?  Castleman was a major in the Confederate Army.  Because of his subsequent civic activities, service in the United States Army and rank of Brigadier General, he was seen as an icon of the new amity between the former combatants.  When the Union veterans held their Grand Army of the Republic Encampment in Louisville in September, 1895, Castleman was the chair of the Reception Committee.  On that occasion Castleman and Colonel Andrew Cowan, a Union hero at Gettysburg (and probably the most important person in the park system history), planted a symbolic “tree of peace” in a public ceremony in Cherokee Park.   When President Wilson came to Hodgenville in September, 1916 to accept the Lincoln Cabin Memorial on behalf of the nation, Castleman was on the podium to make an introduction, describing Lincoln as “the man of humble birth whose achievements furnish to all mankind everlasting inspiration”  and proclaiming former Confederates’ re-integration into the national citizenry.  Castleman is portrayed as an equestrian, not a military officer, in the statue. It symbolized to  Louisvillians their sophistication and commercial ambition to be the “Gateway to the South” and a neutral meeting point between former combatants.
The second underlying theme is the ‘City Beautiful’ movement.  After the great success of  the World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893, cities across the country sought to emulate its neo-classical and Renaissance Revival architecture, parks and parkways, public monuments, and traffic circles with columns or statuary.  Artists, architects and planners such as Louis Comfort Tiffany, Daniel Chester French, Augustus Saint-Gaudens, John Russell Pope, Daniel Burnham, Frederick Law Olmsted and John Singer Sargent, contributed toward this move for beautifying cities with artistic enhancements and public recreation grounds.   The sculptor selected for the Castleman monument, Roland Hinton Perry, contributed many monuments for City Beautiful buildings and plans, such as the Library of Congress (1894), the Court of Neptune fountain between the United States Supreme Court and the Library of Congress (1895), the figure of Commonwealth on the top of the Pennsylvania State Capitol (1905), and the lions on Washington’s Connecticut Avenue Bridge (1906).  Most significant in this context was his monumental column “Reconciliation” erected in 1910 at Lookout Mountain, Tennessee, topped by figures of Union and Confederate soldiers shaking hands. 
  In 1911, when the plan for the equestrian statue of Castleman was first announced, a member of the steering committee, John W. Barr, Jr. remarked, “the General has been accustomed to riding good horses… and we want this horse to be the very best that the General will approve of and we want the statue of General Castleman to be one that we will enjoy looking at.” Reinforcing the notion that the project was in part aesthetic  the reporter  added “there at the entrance to the park whose beauty is so much his work, will stand, appropriately, an equestrian statue, attracting and arresting attention by the sweep of its lines, the vigor of its pose, the evidence of its truth.”   In this instance the horse was at least as important as its rider. 										
 The sculpture was placed at the head of Cherokee Parkway, at the time considered the entrance to Cherokee Park.  The median of Cherokee Parkway was considered part of the park itself.  Willow Avenue had not been extended, and so there was no division between Willow Park and the main body of Cherokee Park.  The sculpture is not set at a 90 degree angle to Cherokee Road, but is aligned with Cherokee Parkway as a directional element leading to the park.  The statue of Castleman in its urban setting is Louisville’s best surviving example of a “City Beautiful” (or ‘American Renaissance ‘as it is sometimes called) project or work of art.
To reiterate, the R. Hinton Perry statue is integral to the conception of how the park system was perceived in the early 20th Century, is a manifestation of the City Beautiful movement, has high artistic merit, and is in its appropriate historic context.  Castleman in 21st Century terms is anything but a hero for many reasons, and it is true that parks were segregated on his watch.  But heroism, real or purported, in my opinion is not primarily what this sculpture was celebrating.
 I propose five actions to help confront assumptions, rationalizations and prejudices that still afflict our community.  First, the George Prentice sculpture in front of the Library now has a placard on either side of the base explaining why newspaper editor Prentice is honored despite following the Know-Nothing Party and his possible role in inciting the Bloody Monday riots of August 6, 1855.  Comparable new explanatory signage might be placed on or near the base of the Castleman statue.   Historical perspective, preservation and moral outrage are not incompatible.  Second, the existing historical markers and plaques on or near the statue should be revised to reflect current insights.  Third, I urge petitioning Don Parkinson, Cabinet Secretary for Tourism, Arts and Heritage in the Bevin administration (don.parkinson@ky.gov), as well as his counterparts in Indiana and Ohio, to take down the website promoting the “John Hunt Morgan Trail.”    Fourth, there is an historic marker at the corner of Second and Main marking the location of the Garrison and Arterburn slave markets.  Couldn’t we do more? A site of conscience, like a holocaust memorial in Europe, is needed.  Finally,  statues are still widely accepted as appropriate ways to honor our fellow citizens.  There is not even a public sculpture of Muhammad Ali in Louisville. There certainly should be one.  We can do better.

40207,"I think that the statues should be left in place for the people who are hurt by their presence to continue to vandalize. While it will not correct what are viewed as our past sins, it will demonstrate what kind of people live in our community now. The more monuments are defaced and vandalized, the more like a ""world class city"" we appear. Also all motor vehicles should be banned and the streets used for bicycles only."
